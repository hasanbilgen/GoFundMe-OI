Jasmine is diagnosed with osteogenesis Imperfecta type 2, also known as glass bone disease. Since her birth she had multiple fractures which led to growing up with a progressive curved spine.Since last year, her spine is progressively curving which needed surgery for correction. If failed to do so, this will impact her multiple organs as the space is already limited. Currently, she is experiencing hardship on breathing and doing regular activities like standing  or being in a sitting position for a long time.Her surgery is scheduled on Aug 22, 2018. Her mother has no funds to support her surgery as it cost 400,000 PhP (7,500 USD). She's a single mom with 5 kids and they don't have that amount of money.Whatever amount you can donate will help change Jasmine's life. She can go to school with no risk of spine fracture. And her internal organs can mature and grow as a normal person.Mother of patient : Maria RomeroFacebook : Jenine Jasmine PedreraMaria Romero's BPI account number : 0069392105",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/fight-for-a-daughter-with-oi#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/fight-for-a-daughter-with-oi#,,,

Mum and I have a bone disorder called osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) which is a collagen defect in our DNA that makes our bones brittle and more susceptible to fractures. Another common trait of OI is joint laxity. As most of our joints are hyper-mobile, they are far more prone to dislocation, tears, and eventually arthritis. I was diagnosed at the age of 3 after breaking both of my shoulders within two weeks. I had a full body X-ray done and the doctors had said that I’d had over 80 broken bones that had probably happened in utero, birth and walking stages. As this disease is so rare, Mum was diagnosed later in her life with OI at the age of 23. This meant that she had a lifetime of mismanagement of the disease. Through lack of awareness, she is in significantly worse condition than I am. She herself has had countless fractures. Twenty years on from her diagnosis, despite only being 43, she has undergone multiple reconstructive surgeries on her knees and wrists. Multiple spinal fractures as well as having a further diagnosis of Degenerative Disc Disease, has left her with significant nerve damage. She can no longer feel her right leg except for when the excruciating nerve pain shoots from her spine into her legs. My mum has arthritis in most of her joints now as well and her knee, jaw and hip dislocate nearly daily. She has also received a recent diagnosis of Fibromyalgia, which is a debilitating condition characterised by extreme widespread pain across the musculoskeletal system. After 43 years of broken bones, arthritis, fibromyalgia, spinal problems, surgeries, nerve damage, dislocations and joint pain, there isn’t a moment in mum’s day where she’s not in pain. Night times are the worst. It’s so hard for me and Gilesy to watch her screaming in pain every night where we know we can do so little to ease her suffering. The house that we have been in for the past 17 years is now becoming too small for us as Mum’s mobility is deteriorating and she relies more heavily on using a wheelchair or mobility aids. Our house simply does not have the room for her to move around freely. When Mum has a fall, it’s an immensely difficult task to navigate a wheelchair to wherever she is and then help her into it. I’m thankful that we both have not required our wheelchairs at the same time or it would be impossible. Mum’s condition, particularly in the past few months, has begun to deteriorate more quickly than expected. Living where we are is simply not an option for us anymore. With research into the property market, the best option we feel is to relocate somewhere close to Warrnambool where houses are more affordable and we can still have close proximity to medical care as well as finding a suitable home for wheelchair accessible modifications. These modifications have been estimated to be valued at $40,000.  We are financially able to service a home loan however we don’t have the additional $40,000 for the modifications needed to make the house a wheelchair accessible home. We are running out of time to find a home and as my mum works only when she is physically capable, we won’t be able to afford this amount given the urgency of our situation.Mum has run fundraisers for many people in need and has been a fiercely loyal support for anyone who's put their hand up and said they've needed help. She's played 'mum' to a lot of my friends growing up and offered anything she could to help those that are struggling. She really doesn't like having to put her hand up and ask for help so I'm putting together this group as a way of gaining funds.To live in a house with enough space to move around would be nothing short of a miracle for us. Anything you could do for us would be such a blessing.Thanks heaps,Sarah xx",,,https://www.gofundme.com/lisgee#,,,

As Fiona's best friend I want to help make that happen and I know you do too!

Olivia is a gorgeous little 11 year old girl who was born with a condition called osteogenesis Imperfecta, or more commonly known as Brittle Bone disease.  She has spent much of her short life enduring many painful fractures, orthopaedic surgeries and long term regular treatment at Sydney Children’s Hospital (given intraveneously with medications to try and strengthen her bones). Although Olivia is 11 her condition has left her with a form of dwarfism and is only 99cm in height.

Olivia is one of 3 children, her older sister is 13 and younger brother is 8 years of age.  Olivia's family is not only unique in the fact that she has this condition, but her Mum also has osteogenesis imperfecta and has Her Dad is a paraplegic and is confined to a wheelchair. Despite Olivia’s parents both having significant physical disabilities, they are blessed with these 3 beautiful children, which are in themselves miracles.

Despite her and her parents both with significant physical disabilities, they receive no financial government support.  With costly out of pocket medical expenses endured with 3 members of the one family impacted by the effects of living with disability it gives little room for saving for a special family trip. Olivia’s, 2 siblings are very accepting of their family unit and never complain about the frequent hospital visits and times that they miss out on having some lengthy hospital stays. The impact on them is the harsh reality of chronic illness and or disability.

If people are willing to support this very worthy family in making this trip a reality it would be greatly appreciated and they NEVER ask for help so its not a SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL!!!

Without it, Deb is unable to get into her pool to complete her exercises that will build muscle and help enormously in  protecting her.Read about Deb's story below:My name is Debra O'C. I was born with a rare, incurable genetic condition called osteogensis imperfecta and it's meant that I have endured treatment and long stays in hospitals for over 100 broken bones. Despite this, I stayed positive and determined to follow my dream of becoming a teacher. Unfortunately, when I was 46 my life changed forever. I had a stroke and this was the beginning of a new set of challenges as I temporarily lost all movement down the left side of my body and required extensive rehabilitation to retrain my brain to do simple tasks and to walk again. With the prayers and support of family, friends and medical staff, I miraculously came home to live with my son and husband again. My stroke had been caused by the most severe form of lupus which can at any time attack major organs of the human body. I had to immediately start 6 months of chemotherapy to keep the swelling of my brain under control. During my chemo, I started having violent seizures, which resulted in multiple fractures to my body at one time including a broken lower back. These fractures have required all my major joints to have surgical replacements and many months in hospitals over the last few years away from my family. My lupus, seizures and chronic pain are treated with 28 tablets a day. However, the lupus still holds me to ransom as it's rapidly weakening my bones; causing chronic fatique; and the daily pain from it requires me to use walking aids and sit most of the day. Lupus has already attacked my lungs and also destroyed my bowel lining when I was rushed again to ICU because I became sepsis. Everytime I now have surgery my wounds require extra attention (also a part of lupus) as I have had staph, cellulitis, avascular necrosis in the hip and even told I would lose my right leg twice to osteomyelitis. I have needed skin and bone grafts, and blood tranfusions so many times that I have just given up counting. What I do count on is the hundreds of prayers that so many beautiful people have said for me over the years to keep me strong.Our goal is that through hydrotherapy  Deb will be able to make the muscles around her bones as strong as possible to give her the best chances of staying out of hospital with broken bones.  My story? In April I have signed up with my brother Jon and friends, Cele and Bruce, to do the Aussie Camino.  Along this journey, we will be walking in the footsteps of St Mary Mackillop. This is a walk from Portland to Penola, with a total distance of a of 240kms. Many have asked if this walk is in order to raise funds or gather sponsors, but that is not what the Aussie Camino represents. I undertook this walk  for me, for my soul to heal a little. My best friend, my husband, closed his eyes for the last time 8 months ago and I continue to find my way in this new world,  one step at a time.John always did, still does and always will inspire me and in his spirit, I deicided I would also walk for Deb. Deb's story is one of courage, strength, hope and positivity which are all attributes John also had in bucketloads. So please feel free to sponsor me as little or much as you like, or just give because you can. If you know of any businesses, or others who may be interested in donating, please share.  The real heroes, Kim P and friends, have been continuously organising raffles and fundraising nights to the cause.

Jazzy has maintained her fantastic, vibrant, sassy personality throughout it all and what has driven her is the goal of going on 2 holidays, 1 to Canberra to visit the science museum (Jazzy wants to be a scientist when she grows up) and 2 to Cairns to find Dory (one of Jazzy's favourite cartoons)As Jazzy's parents, we have had a great deal of financial expenses this year related to Jazzy's independance, and while we wouldn't change this for the world, we would like some help in covering these and seeing her holiday dreams come true. This year alone we have had to purchase a wheelchair accessible car, move house to be in an accessible school catchment zone and lost wages of managing 4 months of hospitalisations.2016 has been a challenging year for our family to manage emotionally, timewise and financially but we know that everything we have done has set Jazzy towards being independant and included. In coming months, Jazzy will have her final surgery for this year, life saving spinal rodding, this will improve her breathing, stop her spine impacting on her heart, manage the pain she experiences daily from sitting or being in a carseat and correct her posture and balance for walking.

Aunty Jules (aka AJ) suffers from a rare bone disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta or, more commonly known as , brittle bone disease. AJ was born with over 14 fractures and spent a signicant amount of her childhood in plaster from her chest down. She had to wheel herself around on a skateboard because the plaster wouldn't even let her sit on a wheelchair.It's an understatement to say she's had a tough gig in life. But despite her disability, AJ has given life everything she's got.In fact, if you didn't know she was in a wheelchair, you wouldn't have a clue what's she's been through. AJ is a TAFE teacher with more passion for her job than anyone I know. She rents her own home and she pays taxes and bills, just like you and I. The funny thing is, when AJ is healthy enough to work, she doesn't even claim a disability pension and gets minimal support from the government at all. But AJ has had a bit of a rough patch this year and 2016 hasn't been so kind. She was diagnosed with fibromayalga (a chronic pain disease), she had a fall out of her chair which resulted in a cracked hip, she's broken over 5 ribs, she's had two fractures in her shoulder blade, and another hip injury. To top it all off, her landlord has decided to sell the villa she has lived in for 8 years. If an owner buys it she will have to move, and if an investor buys it and puts the rent up, she might have to move anyway.Moving house is a stressful time for anyone. But for AJ it's particularly hard. There is cleaning to be done, boxes to be packed, furniture to move, carpet to be cleaned etc. Finding a rental towards Christmas time is hard but it's even harder to find something accessible. There can't be any stairs otherwise she can't get up, there can't be tight corners in the hallway otherwise the chair won't fit. She needs a motorised garage door because she can't pull it down herself, and the list goes on.Because of all her injuries, AJ hasn't been able to work this year and money is pretty tight. Any money you can spare will help Aunty Jules if she has to move or even find temporary accommodation.AJ has a of gold and would do anything for anyone. She's helped me through tough times growing up and been my second mum. She's helped countless friends through weddings, children, divorce, you name it. Now it's  AJ's turn to be given a hand, so any donation big or small will make a big difference to a special and inspirational Aunty.Lots of love and thank you,Kiara",,,https://www.gofundme.com/2rxbrzw#,,,

He then suffered further brain damage and loss of movement in his arm. That arm had a shoulder replacement several months later.Then my dad suffered a fall which broke his leg  with the tibia plated Not long after that he had more seizures which resulted in another fracture and torn rotor cuff.He has had both hips replaced due to his pelvis fracture. My mum is dads full time carer and will not put dad in a nursing home and due to dads frailty mum has a lot of extra care for him to endure.Last year my husband and I had planned to help her with dad on a holiday of a lifetime going on a cruise. 90 minutes before we boarded the ship dads leg slipped off the wheelchair my husband was pushing and dad broke his leg badly. They never got on the cruise ship and he was eventually flown back to Adelaide to have half his femur, tibia and knee replaced. He has since had another fracture of the same leg this year, with more replacements required. Dad has dementia caused by the brain damage and he is only 78.... I say that as he was a fit and healthy man until 4 years ago.Mum struggles daily and receives no help from organizations due to their rural address, they cannot even get a locum doctor. This came to light just recently when dad became ill with a cough which escalated quickly.Dad ruptured a blood vessel in his stomach wall which bled out. He required 4 transfusions. Mum has to rely on Access Taxis to take them to appointments and treatment which is costing over $100 a week.Mum is struggling to make ends meet with dads care and a wheelchair access car of their own would mean they could get dad to and from appointments easier and with less financial burden.

We did it! Austin has received his wheel chair. With all the donations we were able to get his wheel chair.  We are still struggling to cover his continuous medical expenses. I started this Go Fund Me Page to help my best friend, Barbara Burtch. Her grandson, Austin is a 13 year old from Mount Forest Ontario Canada. He is the son of Blaine Hawkrigg and Brent Bickerton. Grandson to Barbara Burtch (Paul) Doug Hawkrigg (Brenda). Austin also has 2 younger brothers Owen and Tyson.  Austin was born with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, it is a group of genetic disorders that affects the bones. It results in bones that break easily. The severity may be mild to severe.  In Austin's case it is quite severe. He was actually born with most of his bones broken. Austin has a difficult time getting around as even the slightest bump can break a bone.  Since his birth, he has had more than 20-30 casts, and 5 major surgeries.  Most of his bones have been broken at least once. His life expectancy is shortened due to this disease. Austin requires an electric wheel chair to give some measure of safety.  This specialized wheel chair is partially funded by the government but the balance falls upon the family. If the money isn't paid the Mobility Organization has the option to cancel the wheelchair request.  It is currently waiting for payment so it can be delivered to Austin.  Besides the wheel chair, Austin needs to travel a couple times a  year to either London or Ottawa (the prefered location) for medical treatments. Along with his medications, specialized care, it is a huge financial burden that the family is stuggling to endure. Blaine is a stay at home mom as Austin requires constant care. His father is unable to work due to health reasons. So there is no extra money to provide him with the treatments and medical devices he needs to provide him with. Austin has anxiety due to his constant fear of breaking another bone.  Therefore, he spends most of his time indoors.   outdoors safely. Austin is a grade 8 student at St. Marys Catholic School in Mount Forest, Ontario Canada. We are reaching out to get some help for Austin and his family.

OI Type 3 is the most severe type among children who survive the neonatal period. osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) Type 3 is a rare disease that causes weak bones that break easily. OI can also cause many other problems such as weak muscles, brittle teeth, short stature, hearing loss, chronic pain and in some cases a shortened lifespan. At this time there is no cure for Nathan's condition. 




Nathan is now three years old. Since birth he has fractured mutiple bones, mutiple times. We are unaware of the total amount of breaks as many fractures go undetected. 




At the age of three, Nathan weighs in at 21 pounds and is around two feet tall. However, due to his disease, he is unable to stand or walk. 




Like any three year old, Nathan wants to be standing, walking and running around. Although he is incapable of doing so at this time, we hope that he will be capable of doing so in the future. That is why Nathan will be undergoing surgery on October 10th, 2017. 




Nathan will be going in for rodding surgery which involves internal ""splinting"" of the long bones by means of the insertion of a metal rod. Under general anesthesia, his bones will be cut in one or several places, straightened and ""threaded"" onto a metal rod. 




Rodding is recommended to control repeated fractures of a long bone, and to improve bone deformities that interfere with function. This surgery increases the possibility of Nathan being able to stand and or walk. 




Nathan will be undergoing this procedure in Calgary, Alberta at the Alberta Children's Hospital. Due to the severity of this surgery we will have to relocate to Calgary for a minimum of four weeks. This will require that I take time off of work. 




We are asking for your support to help us cover our expenses while we are away. This includes hospitality, food, fuel and loss of wages. 




Although we will be located in Calgary during this time, our bills and expenses will still exist in Cranbrook while we are away. 




Any sort of donation to help us as we embark on this new journey will be greatly appreciated.

I'm from a small town in central Newfoundland. The town of Lewisporte. I can't walk so I use an electric wheelchair. I was born with O.I (Osteogenises Imperfecta), which means brittle bones.  I have broken many bones as I was growing up. I haven't broken any since 98. I'm just more careful about the things I do, and how I get around. I lived with my parents untill I was 25 and then moved to St. John's for school and have been living here since. I have to rely on public transit to get around, which is fine, because there's cabs, gobus and metro bus now that are all accessible, but there have been alot of times where I would just like to get up and go do something with friends or go to the store, somewhere in the moment and not have to book a bus, or get a cab or wait for the metrobus in the rain, where also most stops aren't accessible yet.     I go back home to visit family a few times a year; Christmas, spring, and fall usually, since I don't have any family in town. The only way out there is with DRL coachlines. They have an accessible bus, but it is NEVER working, always in the garage. When I book them to travel, I always end up having to crawl on the bus. Its degrading, people staring, crawling up stairs that are sometimes dirty, but most times the attendant cleans them. Most times I get on for free, because I have to crawl on, to which i'm very greatful for, but i'd rather just pay the fare and use the ramp. Crawling up 6 or 7 steps, isn't really the hard part, it's getting from the stairs to the first set of seats just up behind the driver. Its hard because I can't walk and standing alone is putting alot of strain on my legs and sometimes they hurt. I'm afraid one of these days I am going to hurt myself, break bones, or worse fall, back down the stairs. While i'm out home, my family helps me get around if i need to get out to a store or a friends place. I apprecaite them soo much for doing that for me, but it's hard to get my chair into the back of a truck using quad ramps. Sometimes the chair slips off, or during the winter there's not enough traction to get up onto the ramps and i'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody sometime. So this campaign is for myself, to raise funds to buy a wheelchair accessible van. It would make my life so much easier. I've always wanted my own van to get around, to travel,  to visit family out home a little more then I get to now, doing things at the moment of thought; like being able to go places with my friends and use my electric chair while i'm there to explore on my own, instead of just accessible places I can take a manuel chair, or for my worker or friends to take me shopping or to get groceries, to randomly go see a movie on a friday night. I don't have my licence yet, but this would definitely give me the opportunity to get them, and in the future to be able to travel on my own as well. Everyone deserves the freedom to do as they please, to live a ""normal"" life, to enjoy said life to the fullest. A little more independence and getting my own accessible vehicle would do that for me. I would be so grateful to have my own transportation, my own Accessible Van.",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/qu-wheelchair-accessible-van#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/qu-wheelchair-accessible-van#,,,

Hello everyone, We are asking for your support to help get our family to the Shriner’s Hospital in Montreal.Our son Kyler was born on August 19th 2016 and has been diagnosed with a very rare genetic disorder known as osteogenesis Imperfecta also known as brittle bone disease or OI for short. OI is a condition, which makes the bones weak, and so they fracture easily. Kyler, who is only 11 weeks old has OI type three which is the most severe type and has already had 6 fractures. Shriner’s Hospital in Montreal has a clinic that specializes in OI and it's the only one of its kind in all of Canada. The OI Specialists have taken interest in our son and would love to travel to Montreal to have our son see these doctors. We need to raise funds to help cover the costs of travelling to Montreal to get this crucial care for our son Kyler. Any money raised will go towards transportation including airfare and cab rides to and from the hospital, food & accommodations as well as keeping up on bills and stuff at home since we will need to take time off work to go.",,,https://www.gofundme.com/kylers-medical-treatment#,,,

I do own an older van, however, it's too old for a conversion kit to make it wheelchair assessible. Currently, I walk/push Shayden to and from school.  However, his school will be changing to a new location which will make it too far for me to push/walk him.  We are looking to raise money for a used wheelchair accessible van to transport Shayden to and from school, doctor's appointments, and physio. Any additional funds will put put into the house to make it more wheelchair accessible.Shayden is an amazing little boy who has been through a lot of trauma.  He would like the chance to continue a normal lifestyle of a young pre-teen boy.

Kamila and Lukasz moved to Canmore from Poland in 2014, and are now happy to be permanent residents.  Kamila came to work for us at The Phone Store in July of 2014, and she became our sales manager, doing an excellent job, and also becoming a good friend.  She is now on maternity leave from our business.  Lukasz works for Oskar Construction which is based in Canmore.  They are glad to be living and working in Canada, and be part of this great community.  Please support with whatever you can, every little bit makes a difference, and is so very much appreciated!  Thanks for taking the time to read this!More information on OI can be found online at:  http://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/osteogenesis-imperfecta",,,https://www.gofundme.com/28jc47ng#,,,

We've been told to expect complications because of Nathan's bone disease, so we'll be over there for a while. If all goes well, the vision that remains in his right eye should be maintained, and then his left eye will be done. We're very optimistic and Nathan is quite enjoying using his white and red cane for everything other than what it's supposed to be used for :) Nathan is a seven year old who was diagnosed with Congenital Glaucoma and osteogenesis Imperfecta (Brittle Bone Disease) shortly after birth. Since then he has received four eye surgeries, with the hope of maintaining the partial vision that he has left, and has broken over thirty-three bones. His family travels to Vancouver every three months so Nathan can receive infusions for the collagen that his body doesn't naturally produce. Despite all of this, Nathan has managed to attend school on a fairly regular basis - he is in grade two at KELSET Elementary. In March of this year, Nathan was having his regularly bi-monthly eye exam and it was discovered that his ocular pressure was at an ultimate high, and that the drops that are done on a daily basis are no longer working. While awaiting his surgery date to implant a drainage device, Nathan fell off a four foot high slide in his Central Saanich backyard, was taken to Victoria General Emergency, where he underwent two surgeries to repair his shattered elbow, broken wrist, and spiral break that tore his tibia and fibula in half. He is now at home and will remain casted from toe to shoulder for the remainder of the school year. His mom, Jennifer, has had to temporarily leave her job as a part-time teacher in order to care for Nathan for the remainder of the year. The Loukes family will be heading to Vancouver - casts and all - as soon as they get the call to head to Vancouver for Nathan's eye surgery.Any money donated will be to help with medication, travel expenses, equipment that might need to be perchases and aslo to help with all the house hold bills.Please help this family out, as now that Jenn can not work their bills are going to start pilling up.This little guy is an incredible young man and it breaks our hearts for having to see him so through so much all ready in his life. The Loukes family will be VERY thankful of any kind of support that you can give them in a time like this.",Updates   5,https://www.gofundme.com/Nathan-Loukes#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/Nathan-Loukes#,,,

Victor Hanuse (outside right on photo) is 24 years old and has two rare disorders Osteogenisis Imperfecta (Type 6) and Cystonisis. Victor was diagnosed at 11months of age. Since this time he has spent numerous days and hours travelling with his mother Liz to Vancouver for medical appointments. Osteogenisis Imperfecta (Type 6) is a genetic disorder characterized by bones that break easily, often from little or no apparent cause. Victor’s case is very rare and he has very brittle bones. Throughout his life he has broken every bone more than once. He has endured numerous operations to put rods in both legs, plates in both arms and rods down his entire spine. Last time we counted, it was nearly 40 fractures that Victor has suffered.Cystinosis causes crystals to accumulate in all organs and affect Victor’s kidneys most. Victor has crystals that build up in his blood cells. These crystals cause Victor’s organs to shut down, and it requires Victor to take numerous medications.  In 2009, Victor needed to have a kidney transplant, and his mother Liz donated one of her kidneys to her son.  The current medications that Victor takes are:-       microphenolate-       T.A.C-       Investigational meds (NOT approved by FDA)-       Cystagon, & Cysteamine Eye Drops-       Carnitor-       Testosterone-       Bone meds now stopped because it will affect his kidney.Currently, Victor is in the Vancouver General hospital awaiting an operation. Victor fell losing his balance on Wednesday, December 15, 2015 and he broke and bent two rods in his leg and arm.The doctors are now talking about about a new bone drug, Forteo that is not available in Canada. This medication is not covered by Liz’s insurance or DIA.  Forteo is a self-injected medicine costing $1100/month not including supplies and shipping.With Victor’s ongoing fractures, he needs this medication. He will need to be monitored closely. On a bi-weekly basis, both Victor and Liz will need to travel to Vancouver from Courtney, BC. As a single mother with a single income, Liz is worried about the costs to travel, Victor’s monthly medications, and their daily expenses because this will cause Liz to work less as well. It is starting to be more challenging without any assistance. Currently, Liz is researching coverage since Liz’s work insurance does not cover anything, nor BC Former Care. She is waiting to hear back from First Nations health. Compassionate Care would cover possibly 20%. Our families are coming together to help raise funds to cover costs and to reach out for help from GoFundMe and all of you. Any bit of contribution will help Liz and Victor.  If any of you could find it in your hearts to support Victor and his health challenges, they would greatly appreciate it and would like to thank you in advance for your support.  We will continue to update on Victor’s currently conditions post surgery.  Gilakasla",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/tjfk6jgc#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/tjfk6jgc#,,,

OI Type 3 is the most severe type among children who survive the neonatal period. osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) Type 3 is a rare disease that causes weak bones that break easily. OI can also cause many other problems such as weak muscles, brittle teeth, short stature, hearing loss and chronic pain, at this time there is no cure for Nathan's condition. We were informed Nathan had osteogenesis Imperfecta while he was still in utero, although we had not yet learned what type of OI he had, his limbs were much shorter than average and he was showing many fractures and extreme bowing of his legs. Nathan was born with many fractures including breaks on his upper left arm, ribs and many fractures and deformities throughout his lower limbs. Nathan will need many different medical procedures and treatments his entire life which include physical therapy, rodding surgeries and medical infusions such as Pamidronate which Nathan receives every two months to treat bone fragility. It is unknown if Nathan will be able to walk, and he will most likely need a wheelchair and other large medical purchases throughout his life. Because there aren’t medical professionals in the Kooteneys with enough experience to handle Type 3 OI, We must travel for his treatments and or to see experts multiple times a year. His medical expenses have already started to accumulate and will continue to occur throughout his life.Nathan is now Seventeen months old, Since birth he has fractured both of his arms, his neck and his leg, however, we are unaware of the total amount of breaks as many fractures go undetected. Nathan is a bright and intelligent young boy who enjoys listening and dancing to music, spending time with family and learning and adapting to try and do new activities.

She believes that acquiring the degree is not just something to help herself, but a stepping stone and a demonstration for her children that with hard work and perseverance dreams can come true. She looks forward to giving back to the community and providing a prosperous future for her children. I am so proud of her courage, fortitude, and commitment to make a better life for herself and her children. All of us are desperate to find financial assistance for her schooling and are hoping that you will kindly consider making a contribution to support Melissa's quest for a better life.

For those of you who don't know me, my name is Andy. I'm 29 years old, and I have a rare genetic disorder called osteogenesis Imperfecta (Brittle Bones). Growing up with a disability was not easy. Aside from dealing with the physical trauma of breaking bones and having major surgery every few years; my condition also took a toll on my mental health. For most of my life, I've struggled with depression, anxiety and varying degrees of post-traumatic stress disorder.After a recent downturn, I decided to finally seek help with my mental health issues. Although I'm still going through the process of understanding ""what makes me tick"", I've already learned a great deal. It's made me realise that had I been given access to a psychologist from a younger age, I would have better understood how to deal with all of the things that life throws at you when you have a chronic medical condition.My PlanI want to go back to University to study Psychology and get on the path to becoming a Child Psychologist. I've already got the life experience - now I need the professional qualifications to help younger generations of kids who have severe disabilities and terminal illnesses deal with everything that life throws at them.It's not an easy path. It can take 10 years to become a fully qualified Psychologist. However, after a 3 year degree, I can start working in hospitals and clinics; and pursue my Masters and PhD part-time while I work.Why I need fundingStudent finance in the UK only provide funding for students for their first Bachelors degree. Since I already have a Bachelors of Engineering, I would have to self-fund my studies.I'm applying to as many charities and other organisations as I can find to get grants towards my studies, but the majority of the funding will probably still have to come from my own pocket.I have some savings, but it's not enough to cover 3 years of tuition and living costs.What I'm asking forEach year of degree study costs around £9,250. That's a total of 27,750. On top of this, I'll need a bit of extra funding for books and other resources.All donations, no matter how big or small, would be massively appreciated.What I'm OfferingI don't have a lot of skills that would be relevant to most people (I'm an engineer), but I do like drawing cartoon dinosaurs. Depending on how much you donate, you'll get something from me with a cartoon dinosaur on it. Whether it's a postcard, a personalised drawing, a poster or a t-shirt.I'm also offering some other rewards, like website development and Skype guitar lessons.I don't believe in asking for hand-outs, so I'm offering whatever skills and services I can.My PromiseIf you wonderful people out there can help me reach my fundraising goal, I promise to dedicate the rest of my working life to helping disabled and terminally ill children. I wont sell out and work in the private sector. I'll study my butt off to get my degree, and work for the NHS.",,,https://www.gofundme.com/andys-psychology-degree#,,,

I was born with a bone disability called osteogenesis Imperfecta - otherwise known as Brittle Bones. I grew up surrounded by people putting limitations on me, because they were scared I could break a bone. However, I've pushed my limits, grown stronger, believed in myself, and now live an independent and exciting life.At 22 years old, I am a British Athlete T54 Wheelchair Racer competing internationally aiming to achieve my dream of becoming a Paralympian and representing GB in Tokyo 2020!As you can imagine, the journey from now and till then will be an exciting one, yet also expensive, particularly as I do not have any financial sponsors on board. I've invested all the savings I had into this sport, and I am now dependent on kind donations and community fundraising events, to fund training camps, competions, equipment etc.I've just wrapped up my 2017 season, which went extremely well and saw me break my previous PB's,  and move up the UK rankings to 3rd/4th/5th between my 5 events (100m/200m/400m/800m/1500m.). As a result of my great progress this year, I have been selected for British Athletics Academy Squad 'Parallel Success'  2017/2018.I have set up this fundraising page to raise money for the following for a 12 month period:- training (£1400)- Gym and strength + conditioning (£390)- training camp (£450)- travel and accomodation (£1500+)- kit (£200)- new push rims (£145 a pair)- Cateye Strada Slim Wireless Clock (£45.60)UK competitions can be between £60 - £250 per competition dependent on location and duration. International competions can cost at least £600 - £1000+ dependent on location and duration. The 2018 event calendar has not been released yet, and is not likely to be released until the start of the new year, however, I would like to start getting prepared now.I greatly appreciate each and everyone of you who read this, as I know many of you have already supported me massively on my journey so far.

This is a severe form of OI, a life long condition which affects the makeup of the bone resulting in easy fracturing and deformity /bowing of bones. Fractures occur unpredictably with very little or no trauma. Lincoln has suffered both before and after birth many fractures. He has coped extremely well with this and there is not a single day when you don't see his gorgeous smile or hear his beautiful infectious laugh.Lincoln is currently on a drug treatment called Pamidronate, which is a type of Bisphosphonate. This is not a cure and fractures may continue to occur, however it aims to improve the bone quantity. Lincoln was admitted to GOSH for a central venous port insertion, which is used to give the treatment. He has been attending GOSH every 6 weeks for the last year for 3 days to receive this treatment. Due to his age it is now going to be every 8 weeks and will also now take place at our local hospital in Reading. Treatment time is not a great time for Lincoln but he just seems to take it all in his stride. We can not put into words how proud mummy and daddy are of him. Well in fact our whole family and friends, we are very fortunate and Lincoln is a much loved little boy.Lincoln is delayed with his gross motor milestones and has just learnt to stand with support. As Lincoln is extremely intelligent and inquisitive he is becoming   Increasingly frustrated that he cannot move where and when he wants to.Lincoln has trialled a light-weight manual wheelchair called the Panthera Micro at GOSH. He was able to move forward and backwards, and was starting to grasp the concept of turning after spending 30 minutes in the wheelchair. He was able to push himself in the wheelchair to toys that he wanted,and wheeled himself up to a table to sit next to other children.Lincoln now has this chair at home and is making fantastic progress and use of. This wheelchair is being loaned to Lincoln short-term, however this wheelchair cannot be used outside. Lincoln would benefit from his own light-weight wheelchair. It would make such a difference to Lincoln in the long term. After seeking guidance from a specialist wheelchair company, it is anticipated that the Panthera Bambino Hybrid would suit his needs. This wheelchair should last him 2 to 3 years. It can also be adjusted as Lincoln grows. We are very excited that Lincoln is to trial this model on 30th March 2017 to ensure it appropriate and obtain a quote.so now the hard bit....we would all love to be able to provide the money to buy this wheelchair for Lincoln but unfortunately this can not be the case.we understand that it is a lot to ask but really would appreciate it if you would consider putting your hand in your pocket to help us to reach our target. Any amout would be greatly received .Thank you very much for taking the time to read our campaign .With your help this would enable Lincoln to develop his independence and quality of life.",Updates   9,https://www.gofundme.com/3hckr0g#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/3hckr0g#,,,

He was on Lordship Park in Stoke Newington, and it was stolen within a 30 minute window between 7.30am and 8.00am. We are all devastated, and the implications of what this means for Dom are still sinking in.He desperately needs help to fund a replacement.My brother, Dom Hyams, is 27 and was born with a severe form of osteogenesis Imperfecta (Brittle Bones) and therefore has relied on a very specially adapted wheelchair his whole life. Having it taken away from him is devastating, as he has now completely lost his independence, which is the most important thing to him. He has not only had his wheelchair stolen from him, but he also now cannot drive, as his specially adapted van, adapted and originally supplied by Motability, was made specifically to work with that wheelchair. This also means he is unable to go into his work. Quite ironically, over the last six months Dom has been working to promote the revolutionary new access app assist-Mi, which is designed to make life more independent for people with a disability.The wheelchair is a Balder F280. When he got it in 2010 it cost £17,500. This was originally funded by Action for Kids and The Brittle Bone Society. Balder as a company have recently closed down, so he will need an equivalent specially adapted replacement electric chair. His van will also need to be adapted to work with the new wheelchair. He needs to get a replacement as soon as possible.Dom leads a very happy and independent life. He works full time, and he is a vocal advocate of independence for disabled people. This will all change dramatically without the use of a specially adapted chair. Please help if you can, I cannot emphasise enough how devastating this is for Dom. If the wheelchair is found, we will divide all money donated evenly between two charities - The Brittle Bone Society and Action for Kids, who originally helped fund Dom's wheelchair. Similarly, if the chair is not found but if our campaign exceeds the cost of a chair and new adaptations to Dom's van, any excess donations will be divided between those two charities. Here is a statement from Dom:My wheelchair is my everything really, it is my means of getting around and living a full and independent life including getting to work in Central London in my position as Communications and Digital Director at tech app company assist-Mi. I use it all day every day, and without it I am fully reliant on others to do absolutely everything for me. I am shell-shocked and extremely upset, and if I'm honest I can't quite believe it yet.My sincere thanks to everyone for the support, it is so very much appreciated. ",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/rs24737g#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/rs24737g#,,,

All I want is to be able to stay with my Little Boy and my Husband without fear of being torn away. Elliott has come a very long way even though he is only 2years old. He has fought valiantly and always with the brightest of smiles against a little known genetic disorder called osteogenesis Imperfecta, better known as Brittle Bones Disorder. This disorder causes his bones to break or fracture with little or no force, making him fragile and to be handled with reasonable care. Thankfully, he has been fortunate enough to receive treatment and care for his incurable condition but what threatens the happiness of our family most of all is that of involuntary separation. Although I have been married to my husband Mike for almost 5years, we have had a constant fight to be together because we are currently not in a financial position to be eligible for a Spousal Visa and by extension UK citizenship. Mike is a UK citizen by birth and our son has UK citizenship by heritage; devastatingly I have been told by the UK Home Office that I am not allowed to stay with my family as I am a South African Citizen. I have been given the opportunity to appeal this decision based on my basic human right as a wife and mother but in order to appeal this injustice, I need to come up with just shy of £2000 to pay all the fees associated with the Immigration Agency that represents us. Our representation has put our chances at 99.9% and this final chance we now have is our only option besides taking our chances at representing ourselves. Of course, this jeopardises our chance of success as neither my husband or I are legally trained. We have no other option and if I am sent away, it would not only destroy me but the impact it will have on my husband and son would be equally as great. Elliott needs both of his parents desperately for his wellbeing, growth and continuation of all the treatment he is undergoing, least of all to mention the fortunate family union he has the chance of having, and keeping: The pressure that our family has had to endure because of separation, Elliott's serious condition and our fight to be together has been overwhelming. Our applications for Visa's have stretched over years but every moment we have had together as a united family has been indescribable bliss. After being separated for the first 18 months of our son's life, Mike brought Elliott and I to the UK in October 2013 on a Visitor's Visa as this was the only way I could make another application which we had hoped would allow us to stay together for some-time. Unfortunately, we received the blow of denial only a week ago and have been tirelessly pursuing various ways to raise the money that we need.My husband is in full time employment as he is the soul breadwinner and I take care of my son fulltime because of his condition and my own condition (I too have suffered with OI since birth as well as other health conditions as a result) but our financial situation has collapsed and our only surviving hope is that of begging for help from those who can relate to our plight. Every penny that is raised will go to our Agency, Court and other related fees.On behalf of my son Elliott and my husband Mike, I want to thank you deeply for the time you have taken to read a little bit about our life and to watch the video that we have chosen to share. If you are moved to help us even by simply sharing the page, this is a great thing and would go a long way to make others aware of our challenges and that of people in similar situations.

Thanks to more than 200 contributions and 400 shares, our goal of £2,600 was reached in less than one day. The extra money raised will be donated to the Brittle Bone Society to support people like Thines. After this successful fundraising, we decided to reach larger audiences, raise debates about disabled students with financial problems, who are likely to be affected next year and in the future. In relation to universities, the Rt Hon David Willets’ MP said in his last statement, the government will no longer fund non-specialist help such as note-takers and learning mentors (typically funded for through Disability Student Allowance - DSA). We believe that disabled students should not financially be disadvantaged and no one like Thines should ever go through these problems. Therefore, we set up our campaign entitled #Disabled Students Justice (#DSJ). Our aim is to promote equality for disabled students' access to education and improve their everyday life situation by providing them with support and care. For example, disabled students have to pay full price for an entry in some nightclubs even though they cannot access the whole nightclub. Another area that needs to be addressed is the lack of height adjustable desks in most libraries at UCL. So far, we have the support of two student unions, ULU and UCLU who will certainly help us to ensure that the social care aspects of disabled students are raised and not forgotten.PS- If you're interested in knowing more about Thines' condition, here is a speech he gave on it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o37ioaGJUG0For more information about Thines:  http://thinesganeshamoorthy.weebly.com/ Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/disabledstudentsjusticeTwitter:@DS_JusticeE - Mail:disabledstudentsjustice@gmail.comPlease donate to support us in our campaignThanks a million",Updates   13,https://www.gofundme.com/9byhyk#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/9byhyk#,,,

Jordie was malnourished and unable to sit up and had very weak lungs threatening his life.  This was a great loss and sacrifice bourn by his Honduran family.Now we all know and love Jordie  as the strong and amazing young man he is today.We have had the great joy to visit Honduras several times since then, reuniting Jordie and his Honduran family and performing privately funded trips to provide wheelchairs and other medical equipment to disabled and disadvantaged children.Recently we heard the great news that another child was born.  Our joy was tempered with the revelation that she has the same genetic disease that Jordie has. Honduras is now one of the most violent countries in the world and the support system that helped bring Jordie to the United States no longer exists.  Janet, Jordie and I were deeply troubled for this family, our Honduran family, knowing the great peril to the child’s life and the trials and tribulations of raising any child with a profound disability.  We could not imagine trying to cope in their region of the world.   To most, the situation was hopeless.  For us it was not hopeless.  We immediately entered into prayer and decided that whatever could be done, would be done.   Doing nothing was not and will never be an option. We contacted Shriners Hospital and they were willing to listen and see what they could do to help.  After much prayer and effort the Tampa Shriners unit accepted Jenni as a patient in their “International Program”.  We were overwhelmed with joy and gratitude. Janet and I worked with a handful of helpful individuals in Honduras to help the family navigate the passport and visa process in Honduras.  This was a time consuming and expensive process.  During this time, Jenni suffered several fractures, respiratory issues and terrible infections and was mismanaged by local doctors, which we funded, who had no experience with OI.  Picture of Jenni while we waited:We prayed in our grief and helplessness during this time for a way forward.   Thankfully , after several months, the family was able to secure all of the needed Honduran paperwork and a Visa to travel to the US for care at Shriners Hospital for Children in Tampa, Florida.  Janet and I funded the  first Florida trip for Jenni and her Mother Doris to Tampa for her care at Shriners.Airport Arrival: It was determined that Jenni suffers with the same genetic disorder as Jordie.  She is underweight and malnourished.  She has had many, many fractures already in her short life and has suffered greatly with this difficult disease.  Shriner's Hospital immediately started her evaluation and treatment.Jenni will need ongoing, twice-yearly care at Shriners in Tampa, Florida and ongoing nutrition and medical support while living in Honduras. Money is needed to support her  and her mothers travel and other  expenses when receiving care in Florida and also for her ongoing nutrition and medications while living in Honduras.We believe that God has called us to this mission and believe that He will provide all that is needed to carry out the plans He has prepared for us in advance.We wish to honor many people's requests to share in this work by establishing this fund for Jenni and her family.",Updates   14,https://www.gofundme.com/Jenni_needs#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/Jenni_needs#,,,

Aloras Story  




On the 29 March 2015 I went for my 21 week scan at my local hospital. I was told I should contact my husband because there was something wrong with my baby. I was told before he got there that they thought my baby had dwarfism and they were sending me to see foetal medicine in another hospital. We went 2 weeks later where they told us they didn’t know what was wrong with our baby but that it didn’t look very good for her. They told us that the likely hood of survival was very slim but they would run tests and bring me back up 10 days later. After numerous scans the Drs continued to tell me that it didn’t look very good and we should go back to see our own hospital and see what they would have to offer. 




My hospital offered us to travel to England for a termination and gave us 48 hrs to decide. We made the decision that we were going to give our baby girl a chance that we were going to fight as long as she would. 




On the 29 May 2015 my husband James was taken into our local hospital sick and was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer he was kept in hospital for 2 weeks and I was picking him up to go to my hospital appointments. On the 2 June we went for yet another scan to be told it didn’t look very good when we were asked to wait to see a paediatrician after waiting for nearly 2 hrs the Dr basically asked us to sign a Do Not Resuscitate form we refused and told him that we wanted them to do everything they can to save her life. 




Our little super Hero Alora came into the world on 20 July 2015 5 weeks early. She took her first breath on her own and let out a little cry she also turned a lovely colour of pink. She was then taken to the Neonatal Intensive care and put onto a CPAP machine which basically helped to support her own breathing keeping her lungs from closing completely. When she was 2 days old my husband was taken into surgery to see if they could remove his tumour. I was with Alora that day when they gave me her diagnosis after having a full skeletal survey done which consisted of a whole lot of x rays. They told me she had a condition called osteogenesis Imperfecta which is Bittle Bones and that if she stayed stable for 2 weeks they would take her to see specialists in Sheffield Children’s Hospital. Within around 15 mins of this news I got a phone call from the hospital that my husband was in to inform that they had been unable to remove his tumour. 




Alora stayed stable and on 3 August 2015 her and I travelled to Sheffield to see the specialists where I was told that she had a very severe form of the condition and that before she was born that every single bone in her body had been fractured at least 2 times. Her ribs had been affected the most with multiple fractures to each rib this has caused her to have a small ribcage making her have small lungs which causes her to have breathing difficulties. She started a treatment which helps to strengthen her bones and reduce the risks of fractures. She went every few weeks to Sheffield for this treatment but now she goes every 3 months for the treatment in Sheffield and to see a specialist team. 




Alora has come through a lot in the last year she had to be put on life support twice last winter due to bronchiolitis and the flu both times we were told that her likely hood of survival was very slim and every time she bounced back. She has a little port that sits in under her skin so that she can get her treatment she is currently on her fourth infection in it for which they are pumping antibiotics to try and save her more surgery to take it out to replace it. She also has a condition called hydrocephalus which means that there is a blockage in her brain that doesn’t allow the fluid to exit it properly so she has had to have a shunt inserted into her brain to allow the fluid to travel out of her brain or she could end up with brain damage. She has had to have 3 surgeries on this to unblock it and change it. 




Alora currently needs oxygen all day every day we hope that in time she will grow big enough and strong enough to breath on her own without it. She also gets fed through a tube in her nose because her chest was weak when she was first born that we are having to slowly teach her how to eat. Also due to her condition and the weakness of her spine she is not allowed to be sat up any higher than 30 degrees so she travels in a lie flat car seat everywhere this allows her spine time to strengthen and allows her airways to be open at all times. 




Alora will live with this condition her whole life she will be wheelchair bound her whole life also. She faces many surgeries in her life time but we don’t plan on letting this hold her back. We want her to live a full and exciting life. We are a family of 5 Myself (Selina), James, Rhys our 16yr old son, Charlie our 9yr old son and princess Alora who we all dote on. We currently live in a small 2 bedroom house that is really not suitable for our family we need a bungalow with enough room to accommodate all of Aloras needs. 
We also do not have a car that is suitable for Aloras needs I need to be able to have enough access to work with Alora in emergency circumstances but to also be able to go out as a family but as Alora takes up 3 seats we can’t go out as a family at all. 




As Alora spent the whole of her first life in hospital we like to enjoy all of our time while she is out with us. 




Due to my husbands cancer he has been unable to return to work on a full time basis and has had to actually give it up completely recently. As I am the full time carer for both James and Alora but also raising my other 2 children I have had to give up my career as well. We have always kept ourselves financially but for obvious reasons we can’t quite do this anymore we get by and are trying to give our children the best life we can.
As for now my husband continues to receive treatment for his cancer and Alora travels up and down to hospitals constantly we enjoy every day we have as a family especially since it was time that we never thought we would have but we fight on and will continue to as long as we can our baby girl is a fighter and is strong. She will always be our hero.",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/aloras-story#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/aloras-story#,,,

It is the most common skeletal dysplasia that occurs in one in every 20,000 live births where even a minor trauma leads to multiple fractures. Like all children of her age, Leena wants to play with her friends, go to school, and dance. However, her dream is still a wish since she was diagnosed at birth. She had her leg fractured the very first day of her life when the doctor tried to stimulate her for breathing response by tapping on her back & leg. A few months ago, Leena could not resist but dance when her favorite song played on the radio. Unfortunately, both of her legs were fractured and broken into pieces and was rushed to the hospital. However, it’s not the first time it happened but has been hospitalized with similar cases more than ninth times. According to the doctors who work at Teaching hospital, Kathmandu - Nepal, Leena needs an immediate surgery, which requires $4,000 to put metal rods in her long bones in order to strengthen it. Despite being the only child of her parents- a labor working couple living in Kathmandu, her parents cannot afford to have this surgery and the medical expenses due to the poor financial condition. Thus, I humbly request everyone to put an effort to give joy to this little girl and make her dream come true “be able to stand, walk, and dance”.",,,https://www.gofundme.com/let-leena-walk-again#,,,

This might not be the most usual fund me project, but I just though I might as well just give it a try. I'm an 18 year old girl from the Netherlands, and I hope to graduate highschool this year. I was born with a condition which causes my bones to be weaker and more brittle than normal bones (osteogenesis imperfecta). 

Now I'm not here to talk about my hard past, or rough future or something. I just want to achieve one of my great dreams. And that's making music. I want to inspire those who share the same body condition as me to not to be afraid to step out and do what you like even though you might feel limited, we all know the only limit is the sky! 

Now, I don't work, it's hard to find work and study, and I'm a bit of an outsider when it comes to my looks and it's hard to find a job that will go well with my condition. BUT I'm working on finding some work ;). 


As for now, I'm just asking for a tiny small amount of money so I can start creating music with some right equipment.

Through the generous donations of a group in the U.S., I was able to help sponsor Gemma and her mom to come to Canada for her surgery at the Shriners' Hospital in Montreal. Her first surgery was in August and her second was two weeks ago. Rods were installed in her legs to straighten them and hopefully allow her to walk. Gemma will complete intensive physiotherapy before returning to Nigeria in December. Mercy's greatest worry is the expense to bring Gemma back to Canada each year for her check-up and any follow-up surgeries that may be needed. The Shriners' hospital provides free care until she is 21 years old. We have are fortunate to have had many people offer their homes for lodging and now we would love to help lower the travel expenses for her and her mom for next year's visit. I am amazed by the strength of Mercy, Gemma's mom and the lengths she has gone to in making Gemma's life better for her. Mercy will turn 40 in a few weeks and I can't think of a better gift to give her than being able to help her be the best mom she can be and bring Gemma back here for her annual visit with the doctors.

It is in the lower portion of the Philippines called Mindanao and is near the city of Tangub (at the top and to the left in Mindanao).  She lives with her parents, as well as her older sister.( http://anfrel.org/category/country-profiles/the-philippines/)OI is a rare genetic disorder of several subtypes that affects the strength of the bones.  There are only 13 known cases in the Philippines.  Depending on the subtype, some individuals can break a rib simply by coughing too hard or an arm if held too tightly.  Infants typically experience broken bones from child birth. Occasionally as they grow they develop a curvature of the spine because the bones and muscles of their torso are too weak to keep in alignment.  Breathing can be difficult for some as their rib cage could be restricted. While their intellect is typically unaffected, their physical growth is often stunted from mild to severe. As mentioned, Keira has Type III.  From the osteogenesis imperfecta Foundation ( http://www.oif.org)- Bones fracture easily. Fractures often present at        birth, and x-rays may reveal healed fractures that    occurred before birth.-Short stature.- Loose joints and poor muscle development in arms    and legs.- Spinal curvature.- Respiratory problems possible.- Bone deformity, often severe.- Brittle teeth possible.- Hearing loss possible.- Collagen improperly formed.When born, the doctors gave her only a year to live. However, she is now two years old and still going strong. She is a very happy girl with a vibrant personality and loves to smile.ABOUT FINANCES:Finding work in Ozamiz City is quite difficult as the population is very high and the job availability is quite low.  Finding a good paying job is even more scarse. Keira's Mom, Keilah, has been fortunate enough to have a very stable job at the local bank for several years.  Despite this, the family essentially lives paycheck to paycheck as her Dad is without a job along with Keira's medical costs. Currently, Keira's Dad has been in a more urban city to the north, Cebu, which is on a different island (see map) for two months searching for work unsuccessfully.  The family trys very hard to live within their means.  They live in a very modest home, have no car and have a rather simple and low-maintenance lifestyle.  During the day while Keilah is at work, Keira is cared for by her live in nurse, Shiemi.  Besides cooking and feeding Keira during the day, she also helps Keira to do her PT and OT exercises and therapies.  ABOUT DONATIONS:Keira's medical condition is a permanent one.  Because of this her medical care and thus financial needs are a permanent one as well, so we tried to come up with an amount that would last her several years.  We tried to look at what is the average yearly need, but it varies depending on her health.  The cost of her care typically runs $200-$300 per month.  With the amount we are asking for, we hope this would last up to 5 years or more rather than trying to set up a fund every single year.  This cost includes, but is not limited to: physical and occupational therapy, medications, home nursing, Physician appointments and hospital stays.  It will also be directed to the cost of transportation to Cebu where her Physician is.  This entails taking a 10 hour ferry ride overnight from Ozamiz to Cebu.  This year, Keira is also scheduled to have adjustable spinal rods placed as her back is starting to curve.  All receipts related to her care will be kept as well if you desire to view them.  No money from this account will be used for family personal use.   Keira currently has a personal Facebook page that is more about general sharing.  Please visit her official medical Facebook page to learn more about Keira's birth and the journey of her and her parents from the beginning.  ( https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009974926258)You can also see how she is doing with the most up to date information about her progress and medical needs.   While there, please feel free to leave any encouraging comments, posts or questions.  Thank you!( https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009974926258)",Updates   8,https://www.gofundme.com/supportkeira#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/supportkeira#,,,

He can tolerate weight-bearing in the pool, but not on land. We’ve invested in a wheelchair and a standing device for him, but he needs to be walking in a pool every single day. We’ve exhausted the amount of pool physical therapy sessions allowed by insurance. We’ve paid to use the YMCA, but it’s floors and pool decks are slippery and it’s dangerous with other people using the same pool. There are always a ton of kids who just want to splash and have fun (and that’s what it’s for, right). It’s just scary when someone can harmlessly bump into you - sending you to the floor in pain.

We have found a house for that will be perfect for her to live in. The house does not have a ramp for her wheelchair to enter the house but it does have an accessible bathroom for her. I’m only eighteen so I can not buy the house myself, and my mom can not work because she hurt her back when I was four. We have been moving from one family member house to another. And we are just tired of living like that. So this house would be perfect for me, my mom, and three nieces to live in, we just need help getting the money for the down payment for it. Me and my mom are taking care of my nieces carleigh, cameele, and Caleia since my sister can not be with us right now. We have been living with my cousins for the past two months. Before that a shelter. So we really need this house. Please, please help us. We would appreciate if you beautiful people can help us raise the money for our house.",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/a-house-for-carleigh#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/a-house-for-carleigh#,,,

I am a very independent girl and have been my entire life. This is most likely due to the fact that I have one of the rarest bone diseases known to man. osteogenesis Imperfecta to be exact, and often referred to as a glass baby. I always felt as though I had to prove that with my disability. I was capable of handling my own and had a desperate need to ""fit in"" and be as close to ""normal"" as possible. I hate both of those terms and wish they didn't exist at all so even using them makes me feel shame, but those were the only words I could find in writing this to describe why I am so determined. School kids were cruel to say the least but I am grateful for the lessons they taught me and in the end it made me a better person. It is very humbling to be here right now telling my story to total strangers and even more humbling to be asking for help. With that being said I will move on with my story and reason for my need. I am a newlywed! I just married my soulmate on June 16th of this year. He is an amazing hard working man who takes care of me in every way. I simply could not be more blessed. We lived in a rental home in Lexington NC until a week after our wedding when we learned that we had to move due to the owners passing and family being unable to come to an agreement on the property. This was especially difficult with having our fur baby and my elderly mother who has been battling cancer for 9 years. The timing could not have been worse. We had just paid for our wedding and my husband had lost his job because he had to miss 2 days of work for my mother's surgery at Wake Forest Baptist Hospital. With no substantial finances and no real options, I called my best forever friend and ask if we could stay with her until we could save enough money to get a place. She without hesitation agreed to that and knew that it would take a while as my husband had to find work here (which he already has) and she was well aware that moving into any place is extremely expensive considering first months rent, security deposit, pet deposit and utility connections/deposits.We could have went to other friends as well but where we are now, is where we wanted to be. Before we were married I had spent most of my life here on Topsail Island. It is the place that I have always considered home and the place where I have family. Maybe not blood but blood doesn't always make family. Another benefit of living here is that my mother's original oncologist is in Wilmington which is close as well, and I want nothing more than for her to be comfortable and get the best treatment possible. I have been her caretaker for the past 5 years since her husband passed and needless to say, she is my world. She took care of me tirelessly when I was a child. Sleepless nights in the hospital, watching me suffer with fracture after fracture, and enduring more emotional pain than any mother should ever have to. She was my rock and now I want to be hers.Now after being here a few weeks and trying to save all that we can, it's still not enough. And sadly we were just informed that my friends husbands son, sons girlfriend and baby are being evicted in a week. I completely understand that this is of the utmost importance to her and him. Her husband will be leaving next Sunday for Missouri to move the kids here. It leaves us yet again with nothing and I have no other choice but to ask for assistance. Yes, we could uproot again and stay with another friend on the opposite end of the state but I refuse. It's not fair to my mother and honestly our transportation isnt trustworthy enough to attempt it. I am not even sure that my mom could make that trip in the small truck that we have in her condition. So with all of this being said, I am asking for any help that could be given. It would be so greatly appreciated and when the day comes (and it will) that I can pay it forward, I definitely will. I am a firm believer in karma. You get back what you put out, and if I am fortunate enough to be helped, I will most certainly help others in the future. Thank you all in advance for even taking the time to read my lengthy plea. And whether or not you can contribute monetarily, I ask that you please consider sharing this on your social media. Have a blessed day. Peace, love and light.",,,https://www.gofundme.com/ysbr6-a-new-begining#,,,

Because the medical expenses have become such a burden on the family we are starting a fundraiser to help them buy a handicapped accessible van so that Daine is able to get around. Thank you in advance for all of your support!!Daine Johnson is a 5 year old boy with a very busy life. He has already experienced more medically then most people will ever have to in their lifetime. Daine is bravely living with osteogenesis imperfecta (also known as Brittle Bone Disease). It is one of the rarest diseases in the world, only an estimate of 20,000-50,000 people are affected with it in the United States. Getting a diagnosis can take years for some, and for Daine it took over one year and us moving from Alaska to Rhode Island. In that year from when he was 14 months old to 26 months old he experienced six broken bones. He had almost one every other month, and all of them were from falling softly, tripping over a toy, and lying on his arm wrong while napping. Even though we begged, and kept telling our Doctor’s there was something more going on, his Doctors refused to run any tests on him, due to our family having no history of bone diseases. So after feeling like there was no one who would listen or help our baby we decided to move from Alaska to Rhode Island where my sister was able to get an incredible team of Doctors lined up for us.            While Daine was recovering from a broken femur, which led to his first surgery and a few days in the hospital recovering and learning to adjust being in a cast from the chest down.    The Doctors at Hasbro Children’s Hospital immediately ran some genetic tests to find out why our baby was so fragile. In June 2012, Daine was diagnosed with having type 1 severe, and we It is not just caused genetically, in fact over 25% of OI children are caused by a mutation. After being diagnosed, he was quickly approved for pamendronate infusion treatments. The medicine is administered via IV, and takes about 6-8 hours every 6 weeks. He goes to Tomorrow Fund Clinic at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, and two days before treatment he gets his blood drawn as well. He will continue this treatment until his bones are done growing. This is not a cure; this is known to help protect any new bone from curving or breaking as often.            osteogenesis imperfecta affects so much more than his little bones. Due to the lack in production of collagen, he will require on average over 40 Doctor appointments, numerous trips to the Emergency Room, many X-rays and other tests EACH YEAR. He is closely monitored by a cardiologist because his heart valves are made up by collagen. He requires an ultrasound on his heart as well as an EKG. His ears are very sensitive to loud sounds, every 3 months he gets his hearing checked. Some lose their hearing due to any fractures to the bones in the ears, which is why now he wears earphones to keep his ears protected. OI can/or also has affected his joints, tendons, teeth, eyes (very sensitive to sunlight due to the blue sclera), and his lungs.                       Daine was recently diagnosed with scoliosis (curving to the spine) as well. The spine surgeon and his OI Doctor will decide the future plan for him. One option might be putting a rod in his back. He is dealing with a lot of pain in his legs and back due to this. He uses a walker when he needs the assistance, and we are currently looking into wheelchairs for the days his pain is to severe.  No matter what he faces, he does it with so much courage and the biggest smile. He does his best to never let the pain slow him down, or let anything stop him from being just like his big brother Jaidon!! He reminds us every day to live each day to the fullest and love can get you through anything. http://anthonycorsinettis.wix.com/foundation",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/35n4mxw8#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/35n4mxw8#,,,

As a result of my disability, I have had to undergo many surgeries to straighten my bones and have suffered several dozen broken bones during my childhood and most of my adolescence. My arms have broken roughly five times on each arm from little to no strain or reason. As a result of this, it has hindered my overall range of motion and strength.Past, Present, and Future: I first started to pick up Track and Field in the Spring of 2014, not knowing anything about the sport or even what a racing chair was. I still remember going into the chair fitting day, seeing one for the first time and hopping into it. I immediately loved it. I just knew this was the sport for me. Even when I was a kid, I loved going fast and going down hills in my neighborhood. I was always told not to because everyone was afraid that I would get hurt but I didn't care. No one was going to stop me, and luckily, I never ended up getting hurt by flying down those hills. Skipping ahead to my first track practice--I just couldn't stop smiling. I would go around the track and just feel this extreme amount of freedom. You could almost say, happiness in it's purest form. About a week after that on my second practice, it ended up taking a toll on my body and I suffered a broken shoulder blade. This is purely what motivated me to continue the sport. I was tired of being so physically weak and tired of feeling like I had to worry about getting hurt every time I tried a new sport. I started training immediately after I healed from that break and that brings me to where I am now. I am at the strongest point I have ever been in my life and it has been over three years since my last broken bone (not counting the shoulder blade). Training has paid off immensely, not only for racing, but it has allowed me to go through everyday life a little easier. 

Right now, my current goal is to qualify for the national track event this summer in July and my dream is to become an athlete for the U.S. Paralympic Team in the future. Unfortunately, it has always been a struggle to gather funds to purchase equipment. When I purchased my own chair and all of the additional parts (frame, wheels, indoor roller, straps, footplate, speedometer, gloves, etc.) in 2015, it costed nearly $3500. Right now, I cannot pay for a new set of wheels myself. I do not have a backup set of wheels and I cannot pay for any repairs if there was damage to my chair and/or buying new equipment for it. A set of the best quality racing wheels are very expensive (roughly $2000 for a set), however, they would improve my chair’s durability, allow me to have a spare set (in case anything goes wrong), and help me improve as an athlete. Ideally, I would like to purchase these before I compete to qualify for the event this summer.Shoutouts: Before I end, there are many people that I would like to thank for helping me on my journey so far. A lot of the reasons why I have been able to make as much progress as I have are because of the people who believe in me and understand that this is something that I love doing. All of my friends, family, teachers, coaches, and my community give me these opportunities to train and have made sacrifices to help me become the person I am today, whether that be making time during my school day to help promote physical health, practices and meets that allow me to learn and compete with other racers, distances that my family transport me just so I can get in some training whenever I need to, and even people who I don't know that stop and take their time to encourage me. I made promises to a lot of these people that I would continue to pursue my dream, even if I face setbacks or discouragement. As someone who is very competitive and takes great pride in my sport, this is something I will fulfill. I would not be as far as I am today without all of the support I have received from all of them day in and day out. I truly cannot express how thankful I am for everything you all do for me. Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read my story. By reaching my goal, I plan to keep you all updated on my progress over time and show the world that you can achieve your dreams if you want it bad enough. If possible, any donations would be very appreciated. More importantly, please share this with anyone who would find this story uplifting and empowering.""The only limitations are the ones we create.""",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/aparalympicathletesdream#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/aparalympicathletesdream#,,,

So After many fractures, constant pain, and a range of other symptoms the news came that our sweet 8 year old son most likely has a rare incurable bone disease (Osteogenisis imperfecta) . We have since been lucky enough to get an appointment with one of the best OI and genetics team in the country (problem is its all the way in Nebraska). We are raising money to fly us there and back and for a rental car. Please help us fight for Adam!

My cousin Brady, and his wonderful wife Ashley, welcomed their first child into the world on 1/24/17 in Louisville, Kentucky. Ainsley Grace Gray was born 2.5 weeks early and has been in the NICU for the past 4 weeks. She has been diagnosed with a very rare genetic disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta type 3. osteogenesis imperfecta, a type of brittle bone disease, causes Ainsley’s bones to be very fragile and to break easily. She was born with multiple fractures in all extremities, rib fractures, and also fractures that were in various stages of the healing process. There is only 1 other documented case of her specific genetic mutation. Not to mention she has another, completely separate from the OI, genetic condition called Septo-Optic Dysplasia.




OI Type 3 is one of the more severe types of OI and they will be seeking focused care for many years to come. While her doctors in Louisville are doing all that they can to treat her, OI is such a rare condition, her entire medical team have only collectively treated 4 OI type 3 babies in their careers thus far. It is for this very reason that they feel it is in her best care to travel out of state to seek the best focused care for OI infants. Right now we are unaware of the overall cost of her care but we do know that she will be getting a treatment for OI every 8 weeks and they will be traveling to an OI clinic somewhere outside of Kentucky. Brady and Ashley are currently in the process of getting insurance for Ainsley. We are completely in the dark as to the specific needs once they get home. We do know that there are very few clinics in the country experienced in treating OI infants this severe. This treatment at one of the specialty clinics may or may not be covered by insurance. Any and all funds given will go directly to her medical bills, travel, and expenses directly connected to her long-term care.

I am different than most people I suppose in that I have a disability called osteogenesis Imperfecta, or simply, a brittle bone disorder. There are many different types in varying degrees of severity and mine is right in the middle of that spectrum. It was something I was diagnosed with prenatally due to my biological father having the disability as well. Along with this, I was diagnosed throughout my life with restrictive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, scoliosis and asthma. I had my first bone fracture at just two weeks old and to date I have had well over 50 bone fractures and remain wheelchair bound. I also have had major operations, including a titanium rod being put into both of my femurs, and one of my arms. In March of 2017 I suffered two grand mal seizures and with it four bone fractures, a subsequent operation, one week on life support and months of rehabilitation, tests and unanswered questions. The past two months specifically have been quite frantic and I wanted to truly explain what’s been going on in my life, why I’m asking for help.Over the course of this year I’ve been in the hospital six times, my heart stopped twice, I broke four bones, I lost feeling in my left hand and developed what is only currently diagnosed as epilepsy. The severity of these seizures is due to my genetic condition, osteogenesis Imperfecta, a fragile bone disorder. This caused the seizures to bring about the bone fractures which lead to the surgery which lead to the paralysis. I’ve had multiple CT scans, EEGs, EKGs, blood tests, MRI…you name it, all with no conclusive reasoning for my seizure activity. I’m currently on 4,000 mg of anti-seizure medication (which is at that level after having gradually been raised over the years) and I’m still experiencing small seizures every now and again. My neurologist, which took months to get, is trying to really end them as they know my brittle bone disorder makes any seizure a potentially life threatening occurrence.

All by doing normal things; getting his vaccination, kicking his legs like babies do, kicking his other leg.Alex is what they call ""medically fragile"" and if you knew of all his battles he's faced and won so far being 20 months old you'd probably think to yourself, ""Are you kidding me?! That poor boy!"" ...what you've read is only about half of what his life has been like. For right now I'll just focus on one  of Alex's niche in his lifelong journey. He has an undescended testicle which needs a surgery so he doesn't develop cancer as he gets older. As parents we do everything in our power to take care of him and his brothers. But the employee family  medical premiums, co-pays for so many specialists, monthly medical supplies for his NG tube feedings, gas to and from, and outrageous medical bills that we still have to pay 15%  for all medical procedures done is eating this stressed family alive. The stress pushes you to thoughts you never should have to think about. So we are reaching out for the first time ever to family,  friends and strangers to help us get through this and continue on doing the best we can as parents to give our boy best out of what life has dealt him. Thank you having read about our son Alex, and we hope you can make any contribution for Alex and us to continue forward. Today, right now in fact Alex is in surgery. And we have no idea how were going to pay for it. Would you help us, help him? It would mean so much.",Updates   4,https://www.gofundme.com/Alex_Church#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/Alex_Church#,,,

This is Abby Norris.  She turned 10 in February this year. Most of you are aware of her condition, but for those who aren't;  Abby has osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).  She has had over 100 fractures in her lifetime. So far she has had 3 surgeries. At her last surgery, about 10 months ago, we received news of an unexpected surgery.  Not totally unexpected, but we thought it would be further in the future before having to do. It is spinal surgery. There has been a drastic change in her spine in a short time and the surgery had to be scheduled. Abby will have this surgery on August 9th. She has the best surgeon possible for this procedure and he is in Montréal. Abby will be admitted into the Montreal Shriners hospital on August 7th. The hospital and surgery will be covered. The fundraiser is to cover expenses for travel, hotels, meals, medicine, equipment, etc.  We greatly appreciate all the love and support we receive. We especially appreciate all your prayers.

He was born with osteogenesis imperfecta also known as ""Brittle Bone"". He suffered multiple bone fractures at birth, and presently continues to fracture his bones. Fractures can occur with just a cough or a sneeze. While putting a sock on him at 3 weeks old, his left lower leg (tibia) fractured. He had to be handled like China Glass. Holding and feeding him was difficult because fractures easily occured.It was heart wrenching , and painful for Ben.  Amazing Ben not only suffers bone fractures but also lives with secondary issues. He has had multiple neuro surgeries for hydrocephalus and problems with Chiari Malformation. He was in the pediatric intensive care on his first and second birthday, and all of the holiday seasons. We flew him to the best neurosurgeons in the United States. He suffered a stroke this year in April atUCLA Medical Center while surgeons tried closing the 7.5in gap of his skull that exposes his brain to the world and has a high risk for injury. The stroke has changed the life of Amazing Ben and has set up new milestones for him. We are grateful for his life and our chance to share the time that we have with him each and every day.   After all that Ben has been through he continues to amaze teachers of his high intelligence. He is at first grade level and continues to progress in a physically challenged way. Amazing Ben is growing up and he will continue to face challenges on a daily basis. He measures 29in and weighs 15lb. We know he will not grow much more in his life, but we know he can live for a very long time . He is bright and smart. We pray for the tools he needs to face this world. We wish for him to see the beauty at the ocean, the animals at the zoo, to be able to attend school one day soon. Without the use of technology that he will require to learn....his intelligence and his ""will""to learn will go unknown.  Right now Ben continues to be pushed in a stroller that cannot be raised so that he can sit at a table or be included in what is going on in his surrounding. At this age....his peers tower over him. He can operate a power chair.., and needs one . The power chairs are costly. He requires a very specialized fitting for a power chair and anything that he wears or rides in. His respiratory system is compromised. His chest /diaphragm is deformed from all of his rib fractures. He requires oxygen most of the time . His conversations with people are cut short at times due to limited air space to speak louder. Amazing Ben loves people and is very very social. Socializing and using his ipad is fun for him since his extremities are shorter then a newborn baby...which makes it impossible to enjoy ""play"".   We will need to provide modifications for our home to accommodate his needs very soon. We do not have the funds for home modifications, especially with the endless medical bills. Insurance covers only so much.   For now our Amazing Ben continues to brighten our lives and brings smiles to ours and even to strangers. We will continue to pray for the tools that Ben needs to progress in education so that he will someday be an independent young man....known as Amazing Ben.",Updates   5,https://www.gofundme.com/53pqeo#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/53pqeo#,,,

She was only seven months old and had osteogenesis imperfecta, which is a brittle bone disease. On June 27th we took her to Madera Valley Children's Hospital for weight loss and breathing problems. They told us we caught it early, that she had a small case of ammonia with fluids in her lungs. She was definitely having upper respiratory problems, so they put her on oxygen. Later she started to develop a temperature and had high levels of carbon dioxide in her system. The doctors gave her IV fluids. Passed a swallow test, but she continued to aspirate after feedings. So they put a feeding tube in and still continued to aspirate. The high flow of oxygen still was not enough to help her breath, so they put a breathing mask on. Soon after they put the mask on she never opened her eyes again, but still would move her little arms and feet and make noises. Her stats seemed to improve as long as I held her, so I held her from 4am to  5 or 6 am the next morning. I think I had a two hour nap in between and a three hour nap later that morning while her daddy held her and if he or I were'nt holding her, her oldest sister was. After a day later on July 21rst around 11:00 am she past away in my arms. She fought very hard to stay with us for a little over three weeks. She was just too exhausted to continue to fight anymore and took her last breath. What keeps me going and gives me peace is knowing she is no longer suffering or in any more pain from her little inflammed lungs. She went home to be with Jesus and is healed from her bone disease, can now breath and rest. We will see her again, she is not gone forever, but is spending eternity in heaven. Love you baby girl, mommy will see you again. She was a very happy baby and never had a break. The only broken bones she received was in the womb and they were healing and infused back together. She was delivered by c-section at UCSF on Nov. 24, 2015 with no other problems other than her bone disease. She has four older sisters Marisa (20), Felicia (15), Veronica (12), and Sabrina who is four. Her sister Sabrina gave me, daddy and her sisters, tissue and asked why are we crying. She then asked where is Audrie. ""Audrie went bye bye."" She went bye bye, where did she go. ""She went with Jesus"" Oh she went with Jesus.

After her parents pressured doctors for an x-ray, they diagnosed her with a buckle fracture in her ankle and sent her home with a walking boot. Still unable to walk, she began to experience back pain that was waking her up at night. Her parents, Brady and Amanda, once again pushed doctors for diagnostics and she was placed under general anesthesia for several MRIs. They found fractures in her body, including in her spine.She underwent a total body scan and due to the multitude of fractures, was diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta Type I - or Brittle Bone Disease.By now Ava hadn't been able to stand or walk for over a month and had endured countless needle sticks and blood draws.She was to undergo 4-5 hour infusions, four times a year, until she was done growing. However, Amanda and Brady were told she would lead a relatively normal life.Ava went in for her first infusion to be done in two parts...to ease her body into it. She had five hour infusions on March 13 and 14. The doctors said Ava would experience some relief from her pain within two weeks.No relief came.On Friday, March 24, 2017 our little Peanut was admitted into Children's Hospital in Omaha...just for the day, just for total body MRIs. This poor girl has endured HOURS of attempted IV insertions, shots and blood draws and due to some suspicious areas on her MRIs, they kept her there and scheduled three different biopsies on Monday, March 27.They only did one. The bone marrow biopsy clearly revealed abnormal cells and this princess we call Ava, was diagnosed with Leukemia.On Wednesday, March 29 she underwent a lumbar puncture and has been typed with B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.  She will go through almost two years of chemotherapy and needs extensive physical therapy.Brady and Amanda are devastated but HOPEFUL and STRONG. She has family that adores her.Their bills are going to pile up. Ava, and her parents, will remain at Children's Hospital for 3 - 8 weeks and the mortgage must get paid, as well as the escalating medical costs.Brady and Amanda don't ask for charity, but everyone needs help at one time or another.

Then, on November 9th, their joy exploded when, after being blessed with three healthy boys, they were told they were having a baby girl!  The pregnancy was progressing normally until February 2016 and a routine follow-up ultrasound revealed that the baby’s legs were shorter than they should have measured at this stage in the pregnancy.  What followed was a whirlwind of doctor, specialist and geneticist appointments.  They were told not only were her legs short, but her arms were as well and there were deformities present.  Doctors determined that the baby was stricken with some type of dwarfism.  Doctors also informed Danny and Lumi that she was too far along in her pregnancy to abort the child in the state of Florida, but, if they were willing to travel to another state, they could have the pregnancy terminated legally.  Because of their strong faith that God has a purpose for everything, He is in control, and that ALL life is precious, abortion was NEVER an option!Although at peace with their conviction to press forward, bad news kept coming:  the baby wasn’t growing, her skull was misshapen, the chest was measuring small, and her limbs weren’t moving.  All very frightening.  Because of these concerns and the possibility of baby Myra being a stillborn, it was decided to deliver early at 35 weeks gestation.  Myra was born on April 26, 2016, at 8:15am, weighing in at 3lbs 8ozs.  Immediately, there was trouble with her breathing and she was whisked away by the team of pediatric specialists.Today.  Myra just celebrated her one month birthday and is breathing on her own.  She continues to gain weight despite her inability to feed on her own.  Her legs are indeed shorter and bowed from the hips.  Her muscles are affected and she barely moves her extremities.  She remains in the NICU in Fort Myers (45 minutes away from her family home).  Because her bones are so weak, she will need injections of Pamidronate every three months to strengthen her bones and hopefully reduce the amount of fractures that she will certainly endure throughout her entire life.  Her first infusion has been administered without any adverse reactions.  Praise God! Lumi and Danny are juggling time at the hospital with Myra while trying to maintain some normalcy for their three young boys.  Back to work, Danny is faced with the reality that bills still need paid and mouths need fed.The Future.  Myra’s medical condition is a permanent one.  Because of this, her medical care and thus financial needs are permanent as well.  She will require constant special, trained care, special equipment, medicine, surgeries, etc.  Along with fractures, she may endure respiratory problems, brittle teeth and hearing loss. The journey will be long.  And overwhelming.  Danny and Lumi are not ones to ask for anything.  Their faithfulness, humility and willingness to serve God in any form have never wavered.  They inspire everyone they come in contact with and are loved by so many.Our goal to raise $100,000 is huge, but our God is bigger and powerful!  Little Myra has purpose and will certainly bring tons of joy with every smile and every milestone reached.  We know that one day, her body will be made perfect through Jesus Christ, but until then, she is ours to care for and love and she will bring many blessings.Prayer Request.  Please pray for strength and peace over Myra’s parents and family.  Pray for Myra to feed on her own so that they can bring her home.  We also ask for her to be pain-free and pray for God’s guidance over the doctors and nurses as they care for her and make decisions concerning her treatment.                                   Psalm 139:13-14              13 For you created my inmost being;          you knit me together in my mother’s womb.              14 I praise you because I am fearfully and           wonderfully made; your works are wonderful,                                   I know that full well.",Updates   9,https://www.gofundme.com/26sfqhw#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/26sfqhw#,,,

Today is the day and the waiting room buzzes with anticipation. Everyone is already there or they'll be making their way by soon. The time has arrived, she's here and she's beautiful, but something is...wrong. The doctors notice immediately that this bundle of joy is rather a bundle of fractured bones and while Brenda wants nothing more than to hold her baby, she can't. Melanie needs to be taken to NICU immediately. Hours go by, but no one moves. Night arrives, people go home and leave Brenda and Jorden to find solace in one another as no one has any answers for the two. Finally, news. It's called osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) aka Brittle Bone disease. She's type 3, the most severe, but still survivable type. Now, there is a name to put to Melanie's illness. There is still so much to find out though. Would Melanie be alright? Could she leave the hospital? Does she need surgery? Infusions? Having no choice but to power through, Brenda becomes the most positive person in the room. God had blessed her with this child, and she made sure everyone knew it. This wasn't easy though, Melanie had fractures to her jaw, skull, ribs, and arms from birth alone on top of her legs and wrists fracturing in the womb, healing improperly. Slowly information came together, her organs and brain were okay, she'll need infusions every month, she might have hearing loss, she most likely wont be able to walk on her own, etc, etc. Obstacles piled against them, Brenda and Jorden decided not to think of the negatives like the medical bills and possible injuries in the future, rather how loved and spoiled-rotten she'd be. In the next two months, Melanie brought miracle after miracle, she began moving her arms and smiling, grabbing fingers, and breaking hearts. Those negatives are still ever-present though. Melanie's medical bills will build and while Brenda and Jorden are strong-willed parents, they aren't miracle workers. Recently, Brenda was on the news and many began asking if she had a gofundme for the many difficulties to come, so the family has made this not to ask for hand-outs, but instead ask for support for Melanie and for the community to come together and experience the blessing that she is.",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/2derk8g4#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/2derk8g4#,,,

Both of Bennett's lower legs, his tibias have micro fractured so many times it left his bones healed at almost a 90° angle, disfiguring his lower legs. Due to his osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disorder) his bones were not strong enough to be corrected before. After breaking his tibia the specialists at Children's hospital in Nebraska felt it was a good time to fix his fracture but also correct his curved bones. The result is he now has beautiful strong straight legs, that we pray may lead to his ability to actually be able to walk in the future. Bennett has been incredibly brave, positive, courageous and amazing throughout this whole ordeal. 
At the end of October I will be taking him back to Children's hospital in Nebraska to have his sutures and splints taken off and his legs examined to see how well he has healed. 
I am starting this fundraising because I want to try and be able to surprise Bennett after his Dr visit and take him to Lego land in Kansas City and a special trip to his favorite store, at the Oak Park mall also in Kansas City, a huge Lego store.

Destiny was born with multiple healed bones and fractures in my womb. The doctors gave her 3 hours to live after birth. As the mins turn into hours and the hours then turned into days. The doctor gave her 3 months at the max to live, but God. Destiny is now 12 years old! Having this vehicle will be a blessing to us, and will help out tremendously. It will avoid us from having to lift Destiny in and out of her wheelchair to get her in and out of our vehicle which can possibly cause a broken arm or rib from having to lift her constantly. Destiny does not walk. She's very limited to what she can do for herself. Destiny likes to go places a lot! Just like any child she do not like to be left behind she wants to go. Even when it's only a quick errand to the store she wants to make that errand, and feel part of the family where she can just get out and go. This vehicle will boost her self esteem to the point where she don't mind feeling confident enough to say to her friends at school that she ""CAN"" attend their birthday parties or whatever festivities that may be going on. Just going to take a scroll in the park on a beautiful day is a blessing.  Lifting Destiny at home to take her to the restroom, in and out the bathtub, in and out the bed, and so on and so forth...has started to take a toll in my health. Causing both back and chest pains for me. That's even with lifting her correctly. She's getting older and heavier to lift. I would love to be able to get the vehicle which will lessen the lifts she gets daily inside the home, and not having to lift her at all when taking her places. Not only would it help get her in and out of the vehicle comfortably and safely, but also save my back so that I can continue taking care of her. Let's not leave Destiny behind! Let's take her wherever she wants to go! Please give whatever you can, and please share.

Throughout my life i've broken a bone over 250 different times. Eventhough my every move has to be preciously calculated and done extra carefully.Eventhough I know the possibility of becoming injured (even from doing everyday things) is and always will be there I have never let this hold me back in life or make me bitter because i've accepted this is how i was created eventhough it definitely doesn't mean it's easy because it's far from easy especially having to deal with the pain that comes along with breaking my bones.  (I have even broken multiple ribs from just coughing!)  Now I really need your help because a few months ago I was hit by a man who was wrecklessly driving a Dodge Ram2500 while I was on the way home from the grocery store () crossing the street in my electric wheelchair. The store I went to that horrible day was located right across the street from where I was living.i went and when i was done shopping I was crossing the street when out of nowhere that dodge ram 2500 came speeding directly toward me and i knew the driver was going way too fast eventhough it was my turn to cross and ran directly into me ejecting me from my wheelchair and breaking my left arm,many ribs,bruised my entire right side of my body from head to toe, as well as shattering my right hip so badly I had to undergo surgery to put a metal pin through these shattered bones in order for my hip to heal.But the worst damage was the phychological damage because the moment the truck impacted me I literally saw my life flash before my eyes and thought this was going to kill me.        I am extremely grateful and lucky to have survived this horrible accident but it has impacted my entire life. Due to me being so injured by this accident the independence I had prior has been completely stolen from me. Me getting hit even destroyed my brand new electric wheelchair which was my only way of getting around by myself. Before this accident i was able to walk around indoors using crutches but ever since the accident and now drs. say i might not ever be able to walk again because of this accident. Since i havent had an electric wheelchair I barely get to go out and this accident has impacted me and my fiance's (who's a little person but doesn't have fragile bones)finances severely because he had to help me do everthing after the accident so he had to stop working to take care of me and hasn't been able to go back to work since. Now he was the only person who could've taken care of me because my mother and older brother (who's married with his own family) live across the country.       I hope you will be able to find it in your heart to donate any amount to help me regain my independence and begin rebuilding my life and finally start moving on after this tramatic event.  Thank you so much for your time I really appreciate you taking the time to read this and please pass my story onto your friends and family because I cannot do this without your help...

Sometimes the bones break for no known reason. The disease can also cause weak muscles, brittle teeth, a curved spine, and hearing loss. osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by one of several genes that aren't working properly. When these genes don't work, it affects how  your body makes collagen, a protein that helps make bones strong.  Because of this disease she will not grow to average size, always remaining a small person. She will always be wheelchair bound with the exception of perhaps being able to use a walker for short distances. In her short life of six years she has suffered from the pain of many broken bones. Last year she broke her left femur and had to wear a body cast for 7 weeks. Then only a little over a month later she broke her right femur and had to wear another body cast for 3more weeks. Her most recent break was in January displacing her humorous.   To improve the quality of her life and make her environment safer for her to move about, there are many expenses involved. The greatest need for Lauren right now is a light weight wheel chair, and a wheel chair van for her many trips to therapy, doctor appointments, and to school. Other expenses would include dental and eye care.  Despite all the broken bones and the pain she has gone through in her short six years, her spirit has remained unbroken. Her bones may break, but her spirit and her smile remain strong. She has brought much joy to our family and those who are privileged to know this little angel, by teaching us all how to find joy and courage in what is truly important in life. Lauren has suffered much, and we hope that she can obtain the resources to improve the quality of her life and her safety in the future.  Any contributions for Lauren will be greatly appreciated by her and her family.   ",,,https://www.gofundme.com/Lauren-Born-Broken#,,,

My name is Hunter, I am 20 years old and live in New York. I was born with an extremely rare brittle bone disorder known as osteogenesis imperfecta type 3. In addition to weak bones, the disorder has an impact on all connective tissue in my body and has left me wheelchair bound since birth.  I have sustained over 400 broken bones throughout the course of my lifetime, the majority of those being severe breaks in my arms and legs. 




 




Over the years, I have undergone numerous treatments in hopes of regaining functionality and bone strength. In addition to having surgery on my arms and legs dozens of times, I have tried a wide variety of medications to keep my bone density at a stable level. The most recent of these medications is known as Prolia, an experimental antibody that has showed promise for osteogenesis imperfecta. In 2015 alone, I broke a total of 21 bones. Shortly after this vicious fracture cycle, I started Prolia and have been fortunate enough to be able to report 0 fractures since then. Despite all experts concurring this is something that I should stay on and be getting twice annually,  my insurance refuses to cover this essential medication. To make matters worse, the cost has recently been raised to $1200 per dose. This is $200 per month for a drug necessary to keep the broken bones in check that I can not afford to give them.  While I am uncertain if Prolia has been solely responsible for the fractures slowing down, I certainly do not want to risk finding out.




In November of 2017 I was diagnosed with Basilar Invagination, a condition in which the c2 vertebra went upwards and back into my intracranial space. My upper spinal cord and brain-stem are both being pressed on causing a large amount of neurological symptoms. There is no easy solution to this, and I am consulting with all experts that I can to find one. General surgeries for this condition do not work with me in light of my brittle bones not being able to hold so much hardware in the neck.




In addition to rising medication cost that I am unable to keep up with, I currently do not have any means of consistent transportation as I do not own a vehicle. Figuring out the most efficient way to drive has been a real challenge for me, as well as a goal for a very long time. I am currently exploring all options, as I am certain that the ability to drive would add in a massive independence factor and completely change my life forever. I have been looking into a variety of different vehicles with hand controls, and have been doing some research on things such as the Kenguru Electric Vehicle which is built for wheelchair users. It would certainly be a dream come true to one day be on the road. I would love the ability to drive myself to appointments and events, and just live life as freely as I possibly can. I would like to lessen my reliance on others, pursue employment opportunies and experience the world with my own eyes.




 




Please keep in mind that the goal amount is not set in stone! I was forced to choose some number. Each and every cent will go towards bringing me closer to my final goal of independence. Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to read this! --

The video started to go viral almost immediately. The next day, I posted a picture of Breanna in the hospital with a cast on each of her legs. That picture initiated some hurtful criticism from people who do not know me or my baby.  However, the support and love of family who do know me and my child have encouraged me to allow Breanna's happy moment to educate others about the back-story of the irony between her precious car seat dance video and the painful picture of her two broken legs the next day.Breanna is the happiest baby you could ever imagine. Yet, she was born with osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder characterized by bones that break easily (i.e. brittle bones), often from little or no apparent cause. Most people who have seen the video do not even notice the cast on her left arm, which she broke while rolling on me. The day after the video, she was in her crib asleep; and I was in asleep when I was awakened by her horrific screams. I looked my daughter over but could not tell where she was hurting. I immediately rushed her to the hospital where they determined that both of her legs were broken.This is the life I live, a single parent with three children. Breanna is the only one of my children who has this ""brittle bones"" condition.  She has had more than 15 fractures and she's only 21 months old. She has to have treatments and eventually surgery, but she will never grow out of this condition. It's a struggle but I wouldn't trade her beauty and personality for the world.  My day to day goal it just preventing breaks and, now, creating awareness about osteogenesis imperfecta.So why a GoFundMe campaign? Aren't there programs and subsidies that help me with her medical expenses. Yes! Medicaid and Social Security. But if you know anything about these assistance programs, I cannot get this assistance while holding a job. It's a catch 22 for Breanna, not me, though. My baby gives me more in one glance than I will ever be able to give her in a lifetime. If, though her video, she brings you any joy at all, consider helping me give joy back to her in some normal way of a mother raising a child each day. Nothing will stop her from dancing, and she will always smile at you with the happiest face, no matter what. God bless you all, and thank you for blessing me with your viral views of the video.

My name is Crystal Skye Robertson. I am 2 years old and have had over 30 fractures in my lifetime due to a rare genetic disorder called Osteogenisis imperfecta (type 8) or referred to as brittle bones. Some of the therapies that can help strengthen my bones are quarterly infusions of a special medicine called Pamidronate (this helps harden the bone, reducing fractures in any cases), there is also rodding surgeries to my legs as this too adds density to the bone and can help reduce fractures, finally exercise, particularly swimming as it is not in my best interest to participate in any contact sports. It would be a great help to my progress to be able to attend swim class and aquatic therapy sessions more than just once a week however it's very costly and my parents are only able to provide what care their medical insurance covers at this time.",Updates   3,https://www.gofundme.com/crystalsjoyfuljourney#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/crystalsjoyfuljourney#,,,

 Designing is one of my best things, I can do.  I love architectural programs.  So, naturally ramps and lifts are designed everywhere and for too much money for those struggling and are not able or fit yet for work.  If money was not an issue, then the only problem would be the design and It’s a challenge!Im not able to build a ramp of course.  So I’m planning to get a lift and shopping for one to find out how much I need.  The dimensions are dictating what I have to afford to where an elevator is the best idea.Im going home right now to see if it’s burned yet, or if we can stay in it and breathe because right now Napa where I live is st Partrick and it’s evacuated and on fire.  Thise are the two easy items.  The hardest thing is the quotes I got for the surgery needed to restore my Oral Medicine and Maxillofacial surgeries.  The price was $45,000.00 usd for a full mouth of teeth like the ones I had.  Or, I can look forward to $17 K and $12 K combined total for the cost $29 -$30 k give or take small fees, to still regrow bone into the surgery enough to apply sloppy unfixed partials made of plastic to the brittle teeth ready to snap from the previously diagnosed conditions.  Hard to choose.  If I live to 84, some 34years from now I’ll need maintenance every 7-9 years replacing pins and cracked bits from normal use.  If I don’t live long and just ten years then I don’t really need super teeth.  Realistically my jaw has problems healing from the amount of missing bone from the first surgery that almost killed me between January and February.  It was half as bad.  Extensive work like implants all through my head aren’t an option in terms of my surgery tolerance.  Another surgery like that with the same amount of infections and swelling on my heart might just kill me.  So I’m going with easy surgical options to clear bone and sew in prothesis $1850 each and I would need four above and below, that’s 8 the math says that’s  $10,000, the sewin jaw PEICE is $2,000 up to $3500 for the top and the special prosthesis for people with cleft pallets and or degenerative tissue disease and then it’s likely a plate to attach to.  The bone section jaw hinge gets me right back to $30,000 again even taking the cheapest teeth reconstruct.  Half of that is $15 K which seems doable if my business made money.  Since I can’t work until I get my biopsies and surgeries out of the way, there is zero chance.  So it’s either build a business and start building the small stuff to help run it and live an efficient life or do nothing and stay stuck in the mud.The torque alone from he suggested install payable in two installments would rip the bottom teeth from the vine they’re installed to due to the bite and natural chewing motion which would be I’m alanced with unfixed prosthetics and doesn’t at all replace or reconstruct what I had before work was stopped half way through.  It also doesn’t include the biopsy costs or plan for them and in whole or in part was refused especially when asked to pay it all upfront.  My insurance won’t cover anything but the X-rays and teeth cleaning and maybe a filling, but other items will need to be by report.My solution was to eas costs with a great idea.  Fixed overdentures sewn into the bone, self grafting and fixed with the two existing implants and two more pins, same for top and bottom.  Any additional bone for maxillary or occipital could be built to that.  If a jawbone is needed often cadaveric bones are used or your bone if there’s a enough to work with has a thing rigged in it which looks like a bicycle chain, the NASO cavity could have the necessary appliance installed treating the lesion created by dentist.  Students can be used as apart of the process and likely will be.  Even still, the extras will cost for NASO sinus reconstruction, cheek and occipital plate and biopsy.  My insurance gets some of the medical expenses but they’re about a fraction of a percent.I will update my totals.  $30 k was the lowest estimate and & $45 k was the highest estimated cost for the oral surgery and medicine.  It’s due when work begins I suspect in November, December if not this month and I postpone due to lack of funding.I will be requesting my study recorded so I can watch and learn along with students and will serve as a memory of the parts and techniques used to place each part.  I always request universities share with Radiology Assistant Coarses where new doctors are made.  My case is extra specially useful for new students wanting to research rare conditions which mimick cancers and how actual cancers visit these conditions really mess up a case. We will all find out just how much life I have left in me with some new pieces to my body, and likely the next will be the hip I mentioned which simply will break one day and be fixed when that occurs enough to fix.  According to the Oxford Dictionary vacuume phenomena of the hip is a seriously bad disease issue where injury or effects of advanced arthritis such as my osteogenesis and osteoporosis arthritis creates false bone which is fragile and snaps back open and then becomes more brittle and eventually won’t support weight.  This condition was diagnosed but not written to paper until 2017 by someone who didn’t think to diagnose the rest of the way?  The next problem is the collapsing IVC with the RA pressure at 3 mmHg p, which could be from somthing else more obsurd than obvious tumors or what appears to be a little of each:  anurisims of the lining of the muscle and the arteries Aorta is part of a problem seen bulging by the notch in the arch and may still be part of the RA which is short for Right Atrium, this abscess may be a defect the reports dismissive tone really angered me since I have the Dx IV collapsing IVC and support of the RA pressure from the Echo and the EKG Stress Test and then the common images Cspine PA view and the CT further denotes an irregular shape and twisting of heart muscle ventricle chambers in total applying pressure over under and around the heart squeezing it and closing the IVC so completely as to make a suction hence my reverse breathing and reverse hiccups and to make it worse neurological signals aren’t being disrupted. I have root narrowing and the growth around the paracardium may well run through the heart causing more neurological issues.  A condition very close to MS which causes blindness.  The coronary arteries all four in a row do not Aline as they have in the last.  Following each artery I found flow was constructed showing budging but not always with color, some comets are indicated, and each side is accurately even in this bulging. The right lung apex is filled with a black dustbunny shape,  irregular edged subtle black space filled with no defects as the rest of the tissue suggests, the alveolar look too fat through, the pleura visceral and parietal is attached to a length qualifying as a mass in its self, sclerotic tissue may be holding the diaphragm together.  I know if no surgeries to the areas only injuries to the areas in 2012. Two cut Lesions are screen a third deep lesion matching the cut scalloped edges is seen all the way through a body shot of the MRI which makes no sense I need terms of standard knives cutting and more like a special surgical tool was used in the trapezius, the artery above the right atrium and aorta, and the right side of the tail section.  I do know USC took some flesh samples of areas but don’t know how it was done without killing me, except the hip double hollow needle, you can’t forget hat. It’s odd having you hip cored like a bottle opener.  Other MD have commented they dont know what they are either.  To finish up the covering to the heart is made up of a ragged edged or pastry edged tissue hanging and dangeling like a dead fish being nibbled in the ocean.  It’s rough it catches the eye.  This ragged edge can be seen in MRI body shot, from the side view the heart in the right side looked compressed too long and flattened on a section of the chest not fatty it’s called the Mediastinum.An almost a double image of the heart sits on top of the RA RV, which looks half raggedy abnormal flattened edges irregular edges lost borders which qualifies as suspicious enough for a good look.  The air space available is nearly nothing, linear scaring of the lung and atelectasis is present on the left lower lobe.  I suspect the back lung section have kept me alive and that the disease seeped at rest draining through to the shoulders where collections formed bones round mounds resembling marble size tumors appearing white on colored MRI. WHERE I stop now, is where the neurological concern rises up to the Cspine.  The pressures around the heart forcing it to budge and increase size underneath the coronary view axial slice is unknown. There is additional black opaqueness in images which doesn’t resemble air and black isn’t natural within the human body, and tan is dead tissue without living blood inside.  Brown bag is hard to spot in images. When Supine my apnea is worse.  My frequent ectopic beats are unexplained.  The brain has evidence of cardinal leads from tumors in the occipital bone explaining the soft exterior and compression fractures diagnosed by USC and reported to spine surgeon.  In all the case isn’t too complexed the problem when looking at one area is that it leads to another area problem.  I noted the look of advanced condition usually seen in autopsy from elderly.  It’s a disease of the skin of the artery which pits and makes cavities much like the intestines will.  Either that or bronchoalveolar carcinoma now known by an updated name.  CAD is likely.  If CAD is diagnosed the evidence is in the bulge of the heart and arteries, the flow, the pressure causing the pressure and enlargement likely from an undescivered tumor visible in an X-ray section in zoom.  I’m thinking bypass. So these topics are pending a root diagnosis which makes sense of what the images are pointing to.If the heart is diseased and a doner is needed there are alternatives to taking a human organ donated do to science.  And sometimes keeping the heart active during smaller repairs can be easily accomplished.  The glandular system needs some testing for cancer and rare conditions.  The hospital has a great doner program.The brain may be inoperable.  But, I’m. It opposed to trading a skull section here, adding NASO prosthetic, a plate to keep the brain from sliding into my chest cavity.  The brain might actually be covered by my insurance.  If I won’t survive the surgery in the opinion of the asser I’ll be getting overdentures and they’ll just let the conditions go and do nothing until I die from the combinations of conditions.Other than that I’m pretty good compared to how touchy I was when I got here.  That’s the best I can do to leave this audience with a clear view of what all I face.  Sure make dentistry look like a snorkel down a waterfall.for the most part my insurance covers some surgery costs.  But I’ll need to be sure to save up for it.The worst is the must do situation.  I figure I have until the cardiac appointment and study is done plus two weeks to read results.  It will be after my consult or biopsey appointment.  If she obtains PCPMD permissions it will be 10/18/17 and plans for surgery will go ahead of cardiac.  I will recover for a quarter year then cardiac will be started. It will take three months.  If nothing is done, I will be starting with New MD and that will take three months.  Dental Oral Facial is upfront payment.  No pressure.Since progress was made, I have an improved team except my PCPMD seems to lack confidence.p or enough data to justify.To make life simple I looked up scissor lifts with man rails and a chain across like a dock loader as a solution.  It will need a base built.  Or the lift being too small in width could be welded to a larger platform on a square scissor set sharing one PEICE of steel or metal ramp with ramps flaps hinged to doc by spot weld.  Repurposed used, items are considerable as long as they are viable in working order,  maintainable, and won’t cost a great deal for energy consumption to operate.  Recharging battery always look like a good option.  The trouble starts in where to apply the ramp and get into the house without aktering the house too much.  There is a window which is on more solid ground and can be converted with two cuts to the floor to accommodate the lift.  The edges can be extended by molding.  In this way either product could work for the best price and the homeowner could also use it later when I’m gone.  The room could do with a remodel for good drywall,  even flooring, and widening.  Half a wall could be taken out but the ceiling might then need to be fixed if it’s supported up top.  Thankfully it’s so small the changes I listed with a good crew could be done in two days and the floor done last in three hours.  The frames for the doorway could be easily upgraded or made to resemble the same moldings used.   Sry little materials would be needed however a scaffold could be used on an eleven foot room height.  It’s not easy to do on ladders.  So I had the idea of a single scissor lift for that and then thought why stop there?  Why not the. Use it for the work and install it after it’s done and simple fold the cart handle when not in use?  The reason is, the cart would need ped to be up to take the wheelchair down to the ground level.  So back to scaffolding, and a lift.Would a ramp design be better?  If so, how would the doorway be made when the floor level is about 64 or more inches and may even be 70 inches when the slab is laid down.  The chair will make it through the frame as is.  But the bottom rectangle at the kickplate level need to be cut out through wall, and will need sealing, new trim, paint, the flooring could be done later on to look nice.Any any alternate ideas would be welcome for this project.  I’m starting with mobility, then oral medicine and surgery.Thank you for your time reading this quick explaination, I know it’s a challenge.  Sometimes we have to ask for help and support even though we think somethings out of reach or impossible.  So I think that it’s out of reach and the ramp is impossible.  The lift is a good idea as a push cart but it really want serve well unless installed at a porch the entryway is too small through the back so the front would be all there is.  The front porch has tree roots and is even higher from ground level.  An idea was made why not get ine chair for inside only and one chair for outside and just put it in a small guard shack shed for when you launch out for a walk or the shuttle?  Then just use small curb ramps.  Used ones, folding ones all work except the incline is at 46” back porch with an entry way I can get the chair up or through due to narrow walls.  The window converted is a better option but the incline is super steep 64 inches with cut out of the wall converted to a door frame by extensions.  The ramp could be three way flaps for entry from any side with rails that pull out or down.  Much like a manlift, a dock loaded, a vestil platform.  A Cage elevator would be neat, but anything too modern looking would be in contrast to the 1901 build.  It would need somthing to tie in well with the building which is washboard white since it’s been a number of colors no one liked.The last option is to find a suitable rental for wheelchair living already outfitted with accessible living spaces with the idea of deterioration of mobility with any age 200 miles from the coast, away from cold temperatures and moisture nearby town or in town.When I’m finished with my dental I plan to make my 3D sculptures and comics again, and improve my store to the $34 a month store plan and employ a few people as interns or students with my MFA, and BS.  I had considered becoming a math teacher for many years and it’s good to have options.  I’ll likely need a brushup internship myself for that now days.  I will be adding a device to my store to play my music station for $250 and offer sound effects with the action figures to go with the comic line.  For now I’ll concentrate in the art and keep it simple.Thank you for reading about my laundry list of improvement ideas, and for your Help and support!  I do read all the comments and love the stories.Truly, DawnFounder of DisbycomicsPROCEEDS GO TO mobility ramp lift, the business building because it’s easy and chipped off the list faster, I can work while I tackle the dentistry which will be a monumental challenge.I am a non-profit outfit, currently all the proceeds go to doing what I like best for 3D characters molding, printing, painting, and packaging to ship.  Digital goods are sold as is collections of small quick animations, music samples are scored for repetitive video games, and New Age music.  Employment is via partnership offsite.  We’re a work at home minimalist company with low overhead.  Compensation isn’t done for non-profit Incase you dint know that, our interns devote their down time to helping us develop and thrive in the pride in good work.  Sometimes this helps build a business and sometimes it kills a business.  Until we are turning a profit we’re stuck in our infancy.With some luck, if we get the business going maybe the dentistry won’t hurt so much.Dreams need to be big but, need ‘t be complexed.",Updates   3,https://www.gofundme.com/Disbycomics-gmail-com#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/Disbycomics-gmail-com#,,,

Many researchers say we shouldn’t live very long but yet here she is in College. She’s a very sweet and humble girl who would do anything for anyone if she cared for them. She doesn’t ask for anything even if she really needs it. She has never wanted us to spend money on her because of our struggles we’ve had over the years. I myself also have OI.   She has always pushed for things and tried breaking out of her shell. She’s also had many disappointments that could have hindered her;   she cried a little then brushed it off and moved on. .  She has struggled in life with her OI, like when she broke her leg at a year old then again once it was healed trying to learn how to walk, or the multiple times her knee dislocated on causing her to not walk for at least a minimum of a week each time if not longer. She missed an entire JDHS year because she was pushed and her knee went out that she wasn’t allowed to return to school. These are just a few things that have hindered her yet she still managed to find a way to go beyond her limits and make her way to the University at Buffalo.  Now she is planning to  study and become a veterinarian (I’m so proud).  However we have hit another wall. Financial issues!  We thought that with her 4.0 gpa and top 20 in her class etc.. she would’ve had some scholarships along with the financial aid the state gives but unfortunately that wasn’t the case. So now we are trying to find a way to pay the tuition for the year. Being on disability can only go so far.  We never ask for handouts from anyone we are usually the ones everyone else comes too, we would give our last dollar if someone needed it. Like the saying goes we’d give our shirts off our back if need be. But this time I’m asking for the help of friends, family and even strangers. The payment is due on September 5 and we don’t have the money for it. I can’t have her miss this opportunity to do something no one in her family has done. She’s the first to strive to be something big. And I want her to make it.  Please I hope you can find it in your hearts to help.

California, 1984 and was taken custody by my Grandparents.  Since then I lived in South America almost half my life because of my Grandfathers work.  I went to good schools, and was really into athletics, especially Soccer!  When I moved back to the states in Florida, I moved in with my Mom and Step Father when I was 14.   So thinking as a normal teen and acting like one, I played Soccer and was Scouted and a team wanted me when I was 16.  Through my birth till I was 16, I used to fall and break, fracture or sprain a lot of bones and always remembered since I started remembering things was that my back always hurt!  Now back to when I was 16.  I finished High School and started working immediately.   I was usually washing dishes for restaurants or building pools, always hurting but giving no thought.  Now ten years later, at the age of 27, still working hard and lifting heavy things and so forth when one day I had a seizure, grand mal, and had to go to emergency where they took a lot of scans.  Well come to tell, the doctors come with the bad news, I have and had Osteogenisis imperfecta.  Had to go to to more specialist, and a bone biopsy to make sure, and sure enough, it came out worse than what we thought, my t score was -2.3.  Now as of today the score is at -3.2.  So after more scans we found out my five vertabrae in my spine were fractured, numerous fractures where I didnt even think i did anything to it.  So since then to now my Grandparents and family have been helping with medical bills and rent or other bills.  Now I need a car to be able to go to appointments and swve to buy a house because im staying in a 2 bedroom trailer whichis awful during the winter, and my disability money goes all into the trailer bills rent and other things.  Im asking for help because I feel horrible for my family usuing their life savings to just help keep me alive and well for now and hopefully ease my pains, physical and mental.  And Osteogenisis imperfecta, I would like evryone who reads this to look it up, you will understand the torment I go through 24/7 for the rest of my life which each day Im scared I wont be able to walk, or worse, get paralyzed and die. But as I said I want not only help for myself, but for others. So I am going to talk to a lot of specialist and will donate a good percentage into finding cures or new medications to help stop the pain, especially to newborns who don't deserve the pain!   I almost forgot.  Having this disease at my age, i unfortunately have kidney stones, EVERYDAY! it's the bones in my body leaching out calciuminto my kidneys  , basically disintegration of my body.  I will also try to make a video so u and everyone can see me and hear me discussing this problem!He tomado la libertad de hacer una traducción al Español para que nuestras amistades en Latinoamérica puedan entender la situación de mi nieto Devin...  Mi historia es difícil de contar. Nací en Los Angeles, California en 1984 y comencé mi vida con mis abuelos a mi lado, desde entonces viví casi la mitad de mi vida en Sudamérica debido a los trabajos de mi abuelo. Fui a buenas escuelas y me gustaba el atletismo, especialmente el Soccer! Cuando regresé a la Florida, tenía 14 años y viví con mi madre y mi padrastro. Así es que pensando y actuando como un joven normal, jugué al soccer y cuando tenía 16 años hasta fui entrevistado por un equipo profesional para una posible oportunidad o contrato. Desde mi nacimiento hasta la edad de 16, tenía caídas y me quebraba, fracturaba o dañaba los tendones de mis tobillos y siempre recordé que siempre me dolía la espalda! Ahora, volvamos a cuando tenía 16 años, terminé secundaria y empecé de inmediato a trabajar . Usualmente empecé a lavar platos en restaurantes o trabajos en la construcción de piscinas, siempre con dolores en la espalda pero sin darle mucha atención. Ahora a 10 años más tarde, a la edad de 27, aún trabajando duro y levantando cosas pesadas, cuando un día tuve una convulsión que se diagnosticó como una convulsión epiléptica (Gran Maul Epileptic seizure), me llevaron a emergencia donde tomaron muchas radiografías y escaneos. Bueno, los médicos me vinieron con la mala noticia de que tenía Osteogénesis imperfecta. ( Es una enfermedad que va desgastando y debilitando todos los huesos hasta que se quiebran o se consumen) Tuve que ir a más especialistas y hospitales, me hicieron biopsias óseas de la densidad de los mismos para tener una confirmación y desdichadamente me salió peor de lo que pensábamos. Mi resultado de densidad fue un -2.3 (Lo normal es 0.0). Hoy en día la densidad se encuentra en -3.2. Así es que después de más pruebas y escaneos encontraron que cinco de mis vértebras en mi columna vertebral estaban fracturadas, estas numerosas fracturas donde ni siquiera pensaba o había hecho algo para que pudiera pensar algún daño. Me han hecho muchas operaciones y fusiones de las vértebras y huesos. Hasta la fecha sufro de tremendos dolores que los trato con medicamentos para el dolor y son muy costosas. Y hasta la fecha mis abuelos y familia han estado dándome ayuda con las cuentas médicas, alquiler y otras cuentas porque estoy deshabilitado y no me dejan trabajar. Ahora estoy con la necesidad de transportación para llegar a mis citas médicas y ahorrar para comprar alguna vivienda, porque estoy en un tráiler de 2 cuartos que sin material aislante y calefacción adecuada es horrible en el invierno (menos 20 centígrados es la norma). Mis pagos que recibo por estar inhabilitado a pagar alquiler y otros gastos relacionados. Estoy pidiendo ayuda porque me siento horrible que mi familia esté usando sus ahorros de toda su vida simplemente para ayudarme y alargarme la vida, y agradecería aminorar mis dolores, físicos y mentales. Y Osteogénesis imperfecta, Me agradaría que todos los que han leído lo escrito sobre este tema, que los lean y estudien para que comprendan el tormento que sufro las 24 horas y 7 días de la semana que sufro y sufriré por el resto de mi vida y que me da mucho miedo que pronto no podré caminar o peor que quede paralizado y perezca. Pero como he dicho no solo quiero ayuda para mi persona pero para otros también. Así es que voy a hablar con muchos especialistas y donaré la gran parte de mi tiempo en tratar de encontrar curas y nuevos medicamentos para detener el proceso y el dolor que conlleva esta enfermedad y con especialidad a los bebes recién nacidos que no merecen este constante dolor.",Updates   60,https://www.gofundme.com/m4uomw#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/m4uomw#,,,

My name is Amanda Dodson. I am 34 years old and I am disabled. I was born with a very rare genetic disease called osteogenesis imperfecta, Type 4. It is the 6th rarest genetic disease on earth. I have lived my entire life in a wheelchair, having others take care of my needs. As a child I broke hundreds of bones and was in pain daily. When my body hit maturity, the breaking slowed down and my bones strengthened more. In 2009, I was faced with the decision that resulted in facing my fears and learned how to begin to live independently. Before, I was unable to do anything for myself. Now, I am able to transfer by myself, bathe, cook, clean, and care for my pets. I was able to keep my house and I achieved a dream I NEVER thought I would achieve! I even have my Driver's Permit now! Now, I have ONLY one more goal that I have been unable to achieve, due to financial hurdles. I wish to get off disability and go to college and become a tax paying citizen. I've been offered a college degree, and driving lessons through Oklahoma Vocational Rehabilitation, but I am unable to afford to pay for a handicap accessible van. This van is the last hurdle I need in order to achieve TOTAL independence. Right now, I have to depend on flaky people for rides. I don't go out with friends, or many family functions because I am stuck at home. I want nothing more than the freedom that everyone else has on a daily basis. Even going to the store for a loaf of bread would be the best feeling ever! Any money I receive will go strictly to my purchase of a brand new van. Any left over money will go into an account to help me pay my auto insurance and tag costs. Thank you for taking the time to read about my quest for independence. I appreciate your time!

The first was posted in October 2013, and may be viewed  here .  I have copied some of the following regarding my background from that posting:I am a single mom, and I have one daughter, age 22. My daughter and I are both physically disabled. We have osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) Type III/IV. We also both have severe scoliosis, are short-statured (4'2"" tall) and we both use manual wheelchairs full time for mobility. People who have OI have bones that are thin, brittle, and break very easily - often without trauma.Since birth, I've had approximately 150 fractures, as well as numerous surgeries to stabilize fractures, correct bone deformities, and strengthen my bones with the insertion of intramedullary rods (which act as internal splints). My daughter is less severely affected than I - she has had approximately 40 fractures and surgeries.Despite the many physical challenges I've faced, I was raised to be independent and financially self-sufficient. My father told me (repeatedly!): ""When you grow up you have to work and support yourself as long as you can. That way, if at some point you cannot work anymore, everyone will see how hard you tried, and they will bend over backwards to help you.""As I discovered (too late, unfortunately) that is not the case.After graduating from high school, I accepted an offer for a job with a major airline as a reservations sales agent. I began my career with the airline in October, 1978. I worked full time for the airline for 22 years, ultimately becoming a reservations sales training instructor.Fractures and surgeries kept me out of work an average of three months out of 12. In addition to basic living expenses, I've always had a lot of disability-related medical and non-medical expenses. For example, although my employer gave me basic medical insurance, because of my medical issues, I paid over 400.00/month for additional coverage. On top of that, there were deductibles, co-pays, etc.Having a disability affects most decisions I make. We can't just live ""anywhere"" to save money. Finding a place to live is complicated. Can we get in, or are there steps? Can we get our wheelchairs close enough to the toilet to transfer onto the toilet seat? Is there enough room in the kitchen to maneuver our wheelchairs and position them so we can open the oven door to get foods in and out? Are there enough lower cabinets to store our kitchen equipment? Is there a drawer at the correct height that we can open and lay a cutting board across to use as a counter (kitchen counters are shoulder height for us)?There are dozens of little things like this I have to take into account to live independently, and any place we live must meet the criteria. After looking at dozens of places to live, there are only one or two that meet our requirements, and if those cost more than I want to spend, I have to suck it up. This is true of just about everything my daughter and I need. Clothes have to be altered. I can't drive just any car. Having a disability affects everything, and none of the choices are easy or cheap.While I was working, I did not qualify for any help from any government or privately funded organizations that provide services to people with disabilities. Any disability related expenses not covered by my medical insurance - medical or non-medical - I had to pay for out of pocket. Because adaptive equipment and home adaptations are outrageously expensive, I learned how to adapt to my environment as much as possible to save money.Over my 22 year career with the airline, I never had the opportunity to accumulate any assets. So, I have nothing to show for my hard work - no house, no retirement savings, nothing. When I had a fracture or needed surgery, I was always out of work long enough to deplete all my sick time, but never long enough to have my long-term disability apply - so I learned quickly how to make my salary stretch to pay those bills that came in when I wasn't working. When I finally recovered and got back to work, I couldn't do they types of part time work other people often take on to meet emergency expenses, such as waiting tables. Most of the opportunities for the type of work that allow people to work around their permanent job schedules to make some extra money require physical ""fitness.""I was forced to leave the airline on permanent disability due to a serious hit-and-run auto accident in October 1998. My car was totaled, and I suffered multiple fractures in my face, arms, and legs. It took me over a year to recover from those injuries, but I was left with chronic pain. When I first left my job, I wasn't worried about the financial aspects of leaving. After all, I'm disabled! And, despite being disabled, I worked! For years! All those organizations that administer programs and provide services to people with disabilities, both government and privately funded, were surely going to ""bend over backwards to help me."" As a matter of fact, I thought I might be better off, because I would qualify for programs and services I was ineligible for when I worked.That's when I discovered how the system works.There are two government cash-benefit programs available to people with disabilities; Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and/or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). SSI is granted to those with disabilities who have never worked (92.1% of people categorized as having a ""severe disability), or those who have not worked enough quarters to be fully ""insured"" into SSDI. SSI cash benefit is about 1/3 of the SSDI cash benefit - low enough to ensure those who receive it will also qualify for Medicaid.SSDI pays 60% of your previous salary. If that amount exceeds Medicaid Income Guidelines, you're out of luck.That is the position in which I found myself. I didn't qualify for Medicaid, and was enrolled in the Medicare program instead. Medicare does not cover many of the things people with disabilities need, such as home adaptations, home health aides, most adaptive equipment, etc.Because government and privately funded organizations that provide services to people with disabilities use Medicaid Income Guidelines to determine eligibility for their programs/services, I'm not eligible for those, either.           I have to pay the same price for everything we need as I would if we were not disabled, but have hundreds of dollars per month of disability-related medical and non-medical expenses. Our ""fixed"" disability related medical expenses (Medicare Parts B and D premiums and prescription co-pays) are over 400.00/month. Other disability-related medical and non-medical expenses vary from month to month, and skyrocket if one of us fractures. I'm trying to meet these expenses on 40% less income than what I earned when working.After experiencing first-hand and being directly affected by my choice to work and support myself for so many years, you might think my daughter would take the easier route and choose to be supported by government programs. Instead she is working towards a Master's degree in Public Health/Epidemiology in the hope of becoming an epidemiologist (she hopes to work for the CDC). If she succeeds (and there's no reason to think she won't - she works hard and maintains excellent grades), this career choice should provide her with enough income to satisfy her basic living expenses, disability-related medical expenses, and disability-related non-medical expenses, along with providing her with excellent medical benefits. I'm incredibly proud of her!Although there have been many challenges over the years affecting our financial stability, up until December 2017, I'd been lucky to avoid any major medical issues for quite some time.Then, on December 23 of last year, I was picking up something on the floor, lost my balance, tumbled out of my wheelchair, and hit the floor really hard (and at a very strange angle; I fell diagonally). I broke my left first metacarpal, had several hairline fractures in my right radius and ulna, and did some additional damage to my right femur/knee. I downplayed the injuries to my right arm and leg at the emergency room because had they applied casts, I would have been completely immobilized and unable to care for myself. Medicare does not cover home health aides for assistance with toileting/bathing/dressing/meals unless one also needs skilled nursing care, and fractures do not require nursing care. Because both my right radius and ulna and my right femur are supported internally by intramedullary rods, I knew they'd heal eventually without external support.Luckily, my daughter was home from college for her winter break at the time, so she made sure I had meals, took care of our pets, and did necessary light housework while I recovered. (This was complicated by her own injury; she sprained her wrist when trying to move my wheelchair out of the way after I fell). Other than trying to get from my bed to my wheelchair and to the toilet and back several times a day (which was extremely difficult - I really need all four limbs to transfer - and three out of four were out of commission), I stayed in bed trying to heal as quickly as possible until she returned to school mid-January 2018.Unfortunately, I still hadn't healed sufficiently to resume my normal activities when she left. Friends stepped in to help care for our pets and do some errands, for which I am eternally grateful. Unable to shop, I relied a lot on grocery and meal delivery services and ate more ""convenience foods"" than I normally would, which increased my food expenses by quite a bit.  I was unable to do even light housekeeping, so had to hire someone to do what was necessary. My transportation expenses increased as I couldn't drive. What little savings I had was depleted during that time.While I'm now almost recovered from my injuries (still having issues with my right knee/femur), another medical issue has arisen. In addition to osteogenesis imperfecta, I also have Dentinogenesis imperfecta . Essentially, the same issues that affect my bones also affect my teeth - they're brittle and break easily. Furthermore, like many people afflicted with OI/DI, my upper jaw (maxilla) didn't develop properly. I began wearing partial dentures at the age of 16. By my mid-thirties, several of my (natural) teeth had broken off. I had to have multiple teeth/roots extracted and new dentures made at that time. I was still employed by the airline and had dental coverage, but even after applying that coverage I was responsible for $4500.00 of those expenses.In the hit-and-run car accident in 1998, my maxilla (upper jaw) was fractured. As a result, my dentures were no longer aligned correctly. In the years since that accident, I have lost four more teeth on my lower jaw. These were the teeth my partial attached to. Each time I lost a tooth, my partial became more loose/misaligned and rubbed against my gums, causing painful ulcers to develop.Because Medicare does not cover dental, I've been just living with the issues. As long as I could chew and eat, I dealt with it. For the past two years, I've only been able to chew on the left side of my mouth, having lost the molars on the right side.Then, last week, when I was watching TV and sucking on a popsicle, I felt something hard in my mouth. I reached inside, and was horrified to discover my last remaining molar on the left side had broken off at the gum line.I now have no teeth with which to chew, and no teeth to which my lower partial can attach. The metal clips which attached the partial to my teeth now scrape against my tongue. The partial is irritating my gums, causing multiple, painful ulcers.  I'm only able to eat soups and soft foods. Even though I can't chew with them, I have to keep my lower partial in my mouth to avoid jaw pain. As I mentioned earlier, one of the issues many people wit OI/DI face is the upper jaw (maxilla/palate) not developing properly. It's too small and too high. Without dentures in my mouth to maintain proper vertical spacing, my jaw closes too much (malocclusion) and causes me considerable jaw joint pain (TMJ).To get this corrected will mean the roots of those five teeth that have broken off over the years (which are decayed) must be extracted, and a new set of dentures made. Having OI/DI makes this more complicated and more expensive. Not all dentists are experienced with/willing to treat patients with DI.Over the past week I've spent hours researching low-cost dental care for people with disabilities, including discussing the issue with my PCP, and while there are programs/services for children, there is nothing for adults unless one is Medicaid eligible. There are places that will do basic dental services on a sliding scale, but my issues aren't ""basic"" and the services don't include dentures. Even if there was a dentist who would treat me with a payment plan, I can't afford what would be years of monthly payments.I've tried to be a pretty good sport about all the stuff I've faced over the years, but this issue has really sent me into a tailspin. I've become really depressed over this situation, and the pain its caused is a major factor with that.Cooking (and eating) healthy meals has always been the something I've truly loved to do. With all my medical problems, eating healthy is so important! Just the thought of having to limit myself to liquids or soft foods for the rest of my life...well, I don't want to think about it. I'd rather not eat at all.But, this is not just about eating. Having tooth roots decaying in my mouth can cause me some serious medical problems in the near future.I've estimated the cost of the dental services I'll need at around $8,500.00, based on what the cost were to resolve my (similar) dental issues 25 years ago (the total was roughly $7500.00, but I had dental coverage then. The total exceeded the maximum yearly benefit the insurance allowed, hence the reason I had to pay $4500.00 out-of-pocket the last time. Costs have risen considerably since that time). If I raise in excess of what is needed for my dental care, any additional funds will be used to purchase a new wheelchair (my current chair is 21 years old).For further insight into our lives, see this video.Thank you so much for reading.

I’m 11 years old, and I was born with osteogenesis Imperfecta commonly known as Brittle Bone Disease. I battle this disease each and every day. There is no cure for this disease.I have broken more than 15 bones, with 2 breaks requiring surgery. I have spent countless hours in hospitals, at ERs, orthopedics office and with specialist. Im an athlete, adaptive and challenged it may be, I still get out there and do what I love to do each and every day. I compete and train in karate, this is my 9th season of baseball, and 4 years of basketball. I know I’m going to break something. It’s just a matter of when, and how bad? I’m not going to let my disease dictate my life at all, what so ever. My mission is two fold. I’m creating an apparel brand structured to inspire and encourage children and adults to get out there and do the things they love to do, no matter what medical disability or obstacle they have in their way. It doesn’t matter, medical, physical or emotional. Rise up, have the courage, strength and heart to overcome them odds. Second is to raise much needed awareness to osteogenesis Imperfecta. Im going to donate 10 % percent of my profits to non profit charities of children battling obstacles, osteogenesis imperfecta foundation for research , adaptive & challenged athlete foundations as well as children pediatric cancer centers to name a few. For Gunner, fractures are nothing to fear, not living life is something to fear. Together, making the difference, changing the course of medical obstacles and disabilities. Money raised will go to start up cost, website, merchandise to start out with, and fees. Gunner has already been giving and donating his time to non profits, and giving this holiday to Ronald McDonald house.

More specifically, a story with conflict in which the “hero” overcomes it, one where the whole world is turned against them, and they rise to the challenge.  We often see heroes in Hollywood as slaying the dragon, saving the kingdom, winning the lady. However there is a type of hero that unjustly gets overlooked far too often, and that is the hero we all see on the streets.                His challenge? Every moment of every day wracked with pain, from the time he was 3 years old, merely a child. Dayne Nourse (son of Dick Nourse, longest running anchor on KSL), struggles each and every day to simply function. His parents first noticed a problem when Dayne complained of pain in his arm, and upon a doctors inspection, he was found to have a fracture. By the age of 4 he was diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta(often called ‘Brittle Bone Disease’). After a year of safeguarding his arm, it had yet to heal. Doctors did several tests, and came to the conclusion that Dayne had Spina Bifida Occulta, and needed surgery immediately. However this didn’t explain why his arm refused to heal. Bouncing between several doctors, an orthopedic surgeon finally suggested that Dayne get a full body X-Ray, the results of which broke his parent’s hearts. He had 5 fractures all over his body and was suffering immensely, while his parents were completely in the dark. By that time his broken arm was becoming horribly twisted and crooked, and metals rods had to be surgically implanted into his upper arms, as well as the upper and lower portions of both legs. Many surgeries were required, each with several agonizing months of recovery.When Dayne was 6, he was plagued with chronic headaches. Upon visiting a neurosurgeon, they were once again dealt tragic news. Due to his soft bones, he had a deformity called “Chiari Malformation”. This caused a lump at the top of his spine, pressing on his brain requiring a fusion in his C-Spine. Years later his back once again became crooked, and he was told that he needed a full Spinal Fusion. All of these surgeries and the intense recovery stretched out over several years caused his legs to fail him, becoming too weak to support him. This has bound him to his wheel chair since he was 8, and even now he has to choose whether or not he wants to have his spine straitened and re-fused once more.With all of this happening to him at such a young age his dreams were shattered. A firefighter, a basketball player, a soldier, all dreams he once held that can no longer be. However Dayne persevered, and turned towards interests in computers, specifically Video Game Design. Once again his dreams were slashed when he realized that he could never become one, not because he was not physically able to do it, or was not smart enough, but because of financial reasons.             Yet despite all of these hardships, despite his never ending pain, he has never once complained. Not about his disability, not about his limitations, but rather he strives to find the happy moments in his life. I am starting this GoFundMe, to help my best friend achieve his goal, to feel like he is a contributing member of society. The funds raised through this fundraiser will be used to purchase Dayne’s new computer, to allow him to pursue his dream of designing video games. Any money raised in excess of what is needed to get the hardware and accessibility software that is necessary for Dayne, will be used to help relieve some of the financial burden of his many health concerns.",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/daynes-dream-to-game#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/daynes-dream-to-game#,,,

I'm not sure where to begin, asking for help has never been one of my strong points.     Admittedly, I am a very prideful individual but I am at a point in my life where I need to ask for help from everyone in order to become more independent.  I have type 3/4 osteogenesis imperfecta, which means my bones break rather easily. Fortunately, I have not had a break in many years.       I work extremely hard day in and day out to keep my body in shape. I use a manual chair without footrests to get everywhere I need to go. Whether it's going to get a simple carry out from a restaurant or going to get groceries daily, I use my manual chair and my own two feet to get there.   It has been this way for almost three years.  I cannot even tell you how many miles I have walked but I know it has been a tremendous amount.     I thought I had achieved a certain level of independence because I could walk miles using my manual chair just to get to a dry cleaners when we did not have a washer or dryer or go  get bags of groceries when my aunt and I needed them.     However, I have come to realize that I cannot keep this up forever and at some point I will have to drive to achieve an even higher level of independence.    In order to drive, I need to go through a driving school that is very expensive and I know for certain I will need modifications for whatever van I get.  So I am asking everyone to contribute if they can to help me reach this higher level of indepenence.   Any money donated will without a doubt be used for the driving lessons that cost $175/hr and for a potential  down payment on a van.  It will be used for the van and necessary  modifications, driving lessons, and health related issues only.     Being able to drive will mean the world to me.  I would be able to help others in a similar situation. When I drive, I will finally be able to go to college without worrying about how tired I will be walking to get there.  Hopefully, this will help me obtain employment too.  I will also be able to drive myself to wheelchair hockey games and  pick up anyone else in the area who is in a wheelchair and may need a ride too.  The games  motivate  me to stay in shape and provide social interaction with others who face similar  challenges. I have made several friends through wheelchair hockey and I look forward to every game and practice.   This will  be a long process, as going through driver's  training school and learning how to use the modified equipment will take time.  I will need everyone's  help to raise this money as quickly as possible.      I will be forever greatful for any amount of money that is donated because I realize that there are many needy groups and individuals that ask for your donations.  I greatly appreciate any amout you can give.    It is important to know how to  drive and  I know I can learn how to drive with your help.  Once I reach this goal, I can drive over and show you what you helped me achieve if you live in the area.  UPDATE:  I would also like to use the money to help pay for  the hearing aid for my right ear or toward  the powered chair I have on order.   This will help my mobility and hopefully help me secure a job. I do not plan on relying on these donations alone in order to cover  all of these things.  So, I have contacted the Michigan Rehabilition Services to see if they can provide me with the assistance I need to help me become employed so that I can earn income to help pay for these expenses.      Thank you for reading my request and donating if you can.  Prayers are always appreciated too!   ",Updates   6,https://www.gofundme.com/ant3693#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/ant3693#,,,

Weighing only 17 lbs, he is at the bottom 5th percentile in his weight and height.  We hope that you can help by donating anything you can so that Eddy can receive the medical help he needs and continue to be our “little warrior.” Your donations would help pay for travel expenses such as hotel stays and gas as well as for childcare for Eddy's six-year old brother, David and 3 year-old sister, Coral. Thank you for your time and may God bring many blessings your way.",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/EddyTeddyWarrior#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/EddyTeddyWarrior#,,,

Although we are working tirelessly to take care of our family; it's out of our budget.Eddy is starting kindergarten in September. We are not comfortable putting him on a school bus because of the risks of the bumpy ride on his fragile bones. We intend to drive him to and from school. He also has 1 to 3 physical therapy appointments every week, and at least 15 or more visits to Boston Children's hospital every year. He also enjoys going to church, stores, and visiting people he loves.It has been a tremendous stress on our family to lift the wheelchair in and out of inferior vehicles. Eddy should have the freedom to drive himself out of the house, into a handicap ramp accessible van, and out to the world that he loves so much.  Sadly, the cars we have are on their way out; with so many broken parts and too much mileage. I remember the day the breaks gave out while I was in Boston with Eddy on the way to his first wheelchair fitting. That broken car caused us a day that no child should ever have to experience.We are asking our community to please help fund the purchase of a handicap ramp accessible van, so we can help give Eddy more Independence as he grows and progresses in his world. Anyone can help in any small way, even $5 makes a difference!  Eddy and our family are so thankful for everything, especially your prayers and kind thoughts. We look forward to more freedom for Eddy. God's blessing to you!",Updates   6,https://www.gofundme.com/eddy1handicapvan#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/eddy1handicapvan#,,,

My name is Ed Verbeke and I have a condition called osteogenesis imperfecta. This rare brittle bone disease has caused me to suffer more than 100 broken bones throughout my life, though I stopped counting long ago. I spent many years of my childhood at Shriner’s Hospital in Philadelphia, PA, to whom I will always be grateful. Now, I stand just 4’2” tall, I walk with two canes, and I use a wheelchair to get around. I am not victimized by my condition, but I am limited by it.                As a result of being on the receiving end of care for so long, I have dedicated my life to helping others. I have lived on a Navajo Reservation in the Four Corners region of the US, I volunteered outreach ministry to Native Americans suffering from alcoholism in SW Colorado, and I now serve as a volunteer chaplain at a nursing home in Pittsburgh, PA.                In order to continue to do the work I love, I began pursuing higher education a few years ago. With the help of local support services, I was able to attend and complete a Bachelor of Science program in Human Services at Geneva College. Now it is my goal to pursue my master of social work degree from The University of Pittsburgh, to which I have been accepted for the fall term, in order to be a licensed therapist/counselor. Unfortunately, the assistance I have been able to secure only scratches the surface of the $10,630 per semester cost.                As a person with a permanent disability, I am limited in my ability to secure the required funds on my own. That is why I am humbly asking for any assistance you are able to provide. Your donation will go directly to my tuition and book costs. I genuinely appreciate any amount that you can give so that I may achieve my goal of helping others by becoming a licensed mental health therapist.

Stephanie was one of his nurses, and she and her son came to love this sweet boy very much. She couldn't bear the idea of him being basically in an orphanage. When his mother passed away, he had nowhere to go, and would have ended up a ward of the state and  would have gone to an institution for disabled children. I would like like to raise some money for her to help with the additional costs of caring for him. He needs  several new things as his are all old and worn out.  Somethings are a larger stroller, car seat,  crib, bedroom furniture, and although insurance  pays for a lot of medical needs they do not pay for many others such as some of his medications and personal items. In addition her car needs some repairs like a new air conditioner. Elijah is heat sensitive, and really needs A/C when traveling in the car, and summer is fast approaching. She would like to eventually also get a larger vehicle so she can transfer him with his wheelchair instead of the stroller which is more appropriate for him. We understand we probably won't get enough money for all of the things she needs, but any amount will help. She has opened her heart and home to this sweet boy, and if you can help with any amount of money, it would be greatly appreciated.

Elise was born with a rare condition known as osteogenesis imperfecta (also known as Brittle Bone Disease). She has incurred multiple fractures throughout her young life (9 years) and all have occured with little or no trauma. Turning over in her crib at 7 months of age, she fractured her left femur and most recently, an innocent trip to the beach and a small jump in the sand resulted in 4 weeks in a long leg cast for tibia and femur fractures and once the cast was removed, 12 weeks of intense physical therapy to learn how to walk again. It was very emotional and very costly.Although she is considered mild to moderate, she still requires multiple visits to specialists throughout the year, bone scans to check her bone mineral density, and IV infusions every three months of a bone density building drug to hopefully reduce her risk of fracture and protect her precious spine from compression fractures. The infusions have also helped relieve bone pain she may be experiencing and with just two infusions thus far, we have witnessed Elise's incredible growth spurt! It is a wonderful thing!This is a lot for such a young, vibrant child to endure, but she is a warrior and although little, she is so mighty. Elise is outgoing and friendly and so kind hearted. We want to be able to continue to provide the best medical care possible for our angel.We are a good family and we work so hard to provide for our special girl, but it would be so wonderful to receive some financial support to help us with the mounting medical expenses we incur with Elise's condition. Even with health insurance, it is not enough. Your donation will be used to get Elise the very best medical care possible to help ensure she continues to thrive. It will help cover the cost of the infusions and visits to the specialists as well as physical therapy if needed. Not only do we have specialists where we live, but also specialists we travel to once a year in Omaha to get the most advanced care for osteogenesis imperfecta possible.  Thank you so much for your help!

Since she was born she's had over 60 breaks that we know about and more that just show up on x-ray without any other indication. The first week in August 2017, Emmy was standing to get on the couch and lost her balance. She fell on her left arm (her dominant one) which resulted in a broken humerus. Fast forward 2 weeks, Emmy was picking up a tube of toothpaste she had dropped and lost her balance getting back into her power chair, this time falling and breaking her right humerus. Tomorrow, August  27th, we are heading to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN to have surgery bright and early on Monday. The surgery is to install Fassier-Duval rods in both humeri. We were hoping to avoid rodding her arms, because other than being bowed, she has good range of motion and overall use of them. She has had both femurs and both tibias rodded and the osteotomies (cutting of the bone) take longer to heal than if she were to break naturaly (that sounds weird). The way things played out has just provided an opportunity to have the procedure done and potentially prevent more breaks in the future.Katie and I have been very humbled by the outpouring of support and offers to assist in any way. We have tried very hard to be self-sustaining, but we want to provide friends and family with a practical way to help our family. The challenge Katie and I have is keeping Emmy comfortable post-surgery. Emmy is about 40 lbs. soaking wet, but with casts, there's an additional 5-15 lbs. In order to move Emmy, we often have to strain and contort our own bodies to get the leverage and grip we need to lift her safely and comfortably. Doing it once isn't a big deal, but doing it multiple times a day for 6-8 weeks takes its toll. A good friend of ours who has similar challenges recommended we aquire a hospital bed that uses an air mattress to reposition patients comfortably and to avoid getting bed sores. In addition to this surgery, we have one scheduled in December to replace the rod in her left femur (we replaced the right one in January 2017 after she fell out of a toddler bed and broke her leg). We think the hospital bed will be a good long term option for Emmy's care. As with any medical apparatus, they don't come cheap. Again, we are extremely grateful for the support and humbled by the kindness and generosity. We don't expect to reach the goal, but we had to put in something, so we decided to dream big. Help in any way you feel you can. If this isn't for you, a simple prayer or thought will be much appreciated. Despite these temporary setbacks, we believe that God has a plan for us, and we fully trust in it.

I always tell him, this is one time when his stubbornness really paid off. His limitations do not hold him back and he njoys serving others! He was injured while volunteering with his men’s work group early this year. In March doctors tried to repair his shoulder, but in August decided a total shoulder replacement is necessary. No feet and now only one arm!? Don’t worry. After recovery and therapy, he‘ll be back at it. Due to using his arms so frequently, doctors have recommended a titanium wheelchair. This will help to prolong the use of his arms and hopefully allow more mobility longer. Wheelchairs are expensive! If you feel led, please grab a tag and visit the GoFundMe page to donate.

I have a bone disease called osteogenesis imperfecta, or Brittle Bone Disease. I am very fragile and my bones break easily. I've been in a wheelchair all of my life.




Despite my disability I try to lead as normal, independent life as possible. I like to cook, watch Colts football, and play video games, just as much as everyone else. My fiance, David (who's making this GoFundMe) and I sell geeky merchandise and go to local conventions to meet our favorite celebrities from shows we watch. With nephew and Millie Bobby Brown from ""Stranger Things"".Dave & I met voice-over actress Jennifer Hale.In December my liver shut down and I nearly required a transplant. I was in a coma in the hospital for 8 days. While comatose, the hospital staff moved me while I could not give input as to how to safely move or position me. They unknowingly fractured my legs repeatedly,  which I am still recovering from. I previously lived in an apartment that had a roll-in shower. We just moved to a condo in March, 2018. Unfortunately none of the baths is accessible to me, so I cannot properly take a bath or shower in our new place. We need to update one of the bathrooms to be accessible. Medicaid will update a bathroom for an accessible toilet and roll-in shower, but I require a bathtub with lift for physical therapy and safety purposes. I have, in the past, slipped with a shower chair that caused me to break multiple bones. A tub with lift (that would be much safer for me) is not covered by Medicaid. So, we're thinking about asking Medicaid to scale back the request to just doing the toilet and removing some walls, but that leaves us to figure out alternative funding for a bathtub and lift. We really need to figure this out as soon as possible so I can properly and safely bathe and do therapy, so anything you can donate toward this GoFundMe. If you cannot help financially, I am looking for a tub that is at least 20-21 inches high (on the outside) and will require a contractor to replace a shower stall with the bath tub. Believe it or not, the actual bath tub lift will be the least expensive of this whole project. ",Updates   4,https://www.gofundme.com/erin-needs-an-accessible-bath#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/erin-needs-an-accessible-bath#,,,

If you have osteogenesis imperfecta you know how lonely and depressing hospital stays can be, and I know you can imagine what it would be like to spend Christmas and New Years in one. She didn't ask for us to do this, but we want to because she deserves it. This is a list of Erin's injuries. Radius and ulna right arm both Tibs by ankles bottom of right femurRe-aggravated some injuries from  her sept surgery on left knee. High left femur, mid to right tib and mid left femur. Definitely broke back somewhere in her lordosis but right now getting films of it would be very hard. Erin is a great person, friend, and admin to two very important groups on facebook who helps severe oi people with life.  She is always giving and putting a lot of her time into helping others.  I think it is time to give back to her and get her a ps4 with a few games and a controller so she isn't so sad and bored in the hospital. if you would like to give to PayPal instead of here please send it to mizzsavie@gmail.comI will be raising money until we have enough then getting this for her from game stop.  I'll upload the receipt and proof that it's going to her.  Any extra money will go to shipping and making sure Erin has all she needs to get by in the hospital.  Her family comes as often as they can but she does spend some time alone.  Our goal is to give her the Christmas an New Years she deserves!!!!  Thanks in advance for your help.",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/ErinsChristmas2014#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/ErinsChristmas2014#,,,

I currently reside with my family in Holland, MI.I have a genetic disorder called osteogenesis Imperfecta, which causes my bones to be quite a bit more fragile than normal. I am married to my wonderful wife, Whitney of five years. Unfortunately, she is handicapped also. She suffers from Cerebral Palsy after a stroke she had as a baby. It renders her right side almost completely unusable. We have been blessed to have found each other, and to have had two unbelievably gorgeous daughters, Ruby (3) and Sylvia (2). They were fortunate enough to be born free of our (or any) handicaps. We would love to get to a point where we can aspire to be the role models our children need.Despite many physical obstacles and the turbulent past, including ridicule and humiliation, we are at a point where one of the last remaining things we need to move forward is a vehicle. Both Whitney and I have limited mobility. Being on our feet for long periods of time, results in extremely limited function afterwards. I am at risk of fractures in my ankles and feet primarily if they bear weight at a normal amount. As a result, it interferes with me being an active and attentive father. To combat our limitations, I have been going through the process to make sure that I have all the resources that would help me find and maintain a job. I am currently waiting for a wheelchair, which will allow me to be mobile for much longer than I am currently able. Which will open a lot of job opportunities for me.Besides the wheelchair, I also have custom orthotics as well as an ankle and knee brace, to help me be sturdy on my feet. These tools are all being gathered alongside my work with Michigan Rehabilitation Services, to help me get started with my job searching, and my first work experience.An automobile would be a complete and total game changer to the current stagnant nature of our attempt at independence and productivity. Unfortunately, we can't figure out a way to obtain one without asking for help from strangers. With this large issue we have.Our goal as a family is to become completely self-sufficient. My wife and I are both SSI recipients and I would love to get to the point of providing for my family without the help of the government.Together we want to prove to the world that we can and will contribute. I have always had to rely on reluctant help from my family who have been distant or inaccessible. We have always accepted with appreciation the charity of others, but again, we want to succeed without the constant obligation of others. We have the opportunity to flourish as a family.

I would like if everyone would Please, help me so I can continue too be independent.I was born with Osteogensis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, a complicated and rare disorder. It's major feature is a fragile skeleton. This causes multiple fractures. My grandparents raised me. The doctors told them I probably wouldn't make it; that I might live six months. I am 57 years old. I am a small lady of about 3 feet tall and I have never walked. When I was younger, it was difficult because I was in and out of the hospital having surgery on my legs, hoping that I would be able to walk. The surgery, however, was not successful! And, life goes on. But, my grandparents taught me to be independent. Even as a young child, they showed me how to be useful. Originally from West Virgina, I moved to South Carolina in 1991My illness caused me to miss a lot of school; so when I was an adult, I studied with the. Horry County Literacy Council and other resources. I want very much to be independent and I have succeeded. I have a power chair to get around in. I live on my own. I drive, a licensed driver for 26 years. I have a part time job. I do my own house cleaning, shopping, and fixing meals. I am able to use a computer and communicate with others who have the same health issues. I volunteer at my church and in any way I can. I watch my health and my budget so that I will never be a burden to anyone. When I first got my license, I didn't have a van, so I crawled through the window of the vehicle. I used pillows and hand controls. When that became too difficult, I got a van so that I could use my power wheelchair. This really made things a lot easier for me. As a result, I became more independent. This made it possible for me to go back to school.My 16 year old van, with over 116,000 miles, is giving a lot of trouble and becoming expensive to maintain. In order to maintain my independence, I need to get a power chair accessible van that is safe and can be depended upon. I work hard; I do all I can think of to be independent and not have to rely on others. Being independent helps me live a normal life. A van gives me independence. I always wanted to drive and be on my own. Thanks to God and prayers, having a van helps me be more independent and live life, have a job, go to church, doctors' appointments, grocery shop, and much more!

I had no insurance so my parents relied on free clinics and my dental work was less than up to par. As a teenager the free clinics closed down,and I still had no insurance. My teeth were already in terrible shape. I have been turned down jobs, bullied,and accused of being on drugs because of my teeth.Now I still have trouble coping because of the pain.Every day is a struggle. Eating anything is chancing my teeth breaking.

This basically means that I have very brittle bones, which can break incredibly easily. I've easily had over hundreds of broken bones throughout my life and because of my disability I cannot walk and rely completely on an electric wheelchair to get around (and I go all over the place, including to college and work).For several months now I have been waiting on the state (which funds wheelchair repairs and replacements for me) to approve me for a new chair, which can be incredibly expensive. Unfortunately it was determined that I was not ready yet for a new wheelchair, even though the one I have no longer works for me and is unfixable. I still have to wait about another 6 months for (hopefully) approval.Luckily, I was able to find a backup wheelchair, but it too needs repairs. Because of the condition it was left in, it also needs new batteries. Although the batteries in the chair still work for just around the house, they're no longer holding a charge and die very quickly. If I try to go anywhere the batteries die and I end up stuck. So because of this I need to purchase 2 new batteries, which both cost around $175 a piece + labor.It also has a broken controller and joystick which is stuck off to the side, making it hard and dangerous to maneuver. That also will need to be fixed.Although I do work freelance and design websites, I receive very little cash and almost all of it goes to bills. I simply can't afford new batteries and other chair repairs... even though I really need them. I really hate asking for help, but if anyone could donate, I would be eternally grateful and it would mean the world to me! I'd love to get this chair working  so I can get back to going out and going to college and work.Thank you!",,,https://www.gofundme.com/funds-for-wheechair-repairs#,,,

She has a bone disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta that causes her bones to fracture and results in her being very small. We took this picture in the spring, when we were visiting her in the dorm. She's pretty happy at Oregon, where she's studying linguistics. She's got my mother's ear for languages.Unfortunately, she may not be able to go back this fall. We've got the costs mostly covered for school and housing for the upcoming school year and going forward thanks to a combination of financial aid, loans, and contributions from her dad and me. However, there is an outstanding balance at the university that we were not aware of until Monday of this week. That outstanding balance is preventing Sophia from being able to register for school.An entity (who shall remain nameless) who had committed to paying for her Spring 2015 term at Oregon failed to do so, and did not inform us that they weren't paying her Spring 2015 bill, and Sophia is stuck. Now the entity has informed us that, due to unforeseen circumstances on their end, they will not be able to pay what they had promised Sophia they would pay. And despite our careful planning for the upcoming school year, unless this overdue balance is paid, Sophia will have to quit college.Getting to University of Oregon was a difficult journey. She attended University of Iowa for a year, and then moved to Oregon with us when her dad took a job in Portland. After a year of community college, where she took general education classes so she wouldn't fall behind, she had a fantastic year at Oregon, maintaining a solid B average, and is more than halfway to reaching her Bachelor's degree. She is determined to finish this degree, because she knows that without it, she has no chance of supporting herself. Fractures and surgeries sometimes interfered with her childhood education, and snow and ice impeded her wheelchair when she attended school in Iowa, but this is by far the most frustrating obstacle of all. Had we known the entity would fail to fulfill their promise back in the spring, we would have done what needed to be done to pay the bill at the time. Instead, we are faced with less than a month to put together money for a rather large school bill--in addition to paying first and last-month's rent on Sophia's first apartment, acquiring the adaptive kitchen equipment she will need to cook for herself, and obtaining a rental power wheelchair to use while she's on campus. Money was squeaky-tight already, and this bill is impossible to pay in such a short time. Her dad is investigating cashing in his retirement, but since he's only been with the company two years, there isn't much in that account. And that's why I'm asking for the full amount (plus a cushion for the fees for this crowdsourcing website). We don't know yet what the answer will be from his company, and time is ticking away. Please help us get Sophia back to university so she can complete the education she's worked so hard to achieve. Any assistance would be amazing. Thanks for reading the whole thing, and thank you for your support.",Updates   6,https://www.gofundme.com/LUhMf8Ma#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/LUhMf8Ma#,,,

When I came into this world I had a medical condition that was very rear at that time. Only 10 in the world had what is called osteogenesis imperfecta or in layman's  terms ( brittle bones ). At the time of my birth I had 17 broken bones and the local hospital to my mom to take me home and that I would die in a few days or weeks. Well, my mother wasn't going to take that answer and so went looking for help for me. I had 8 other siblings so mo had her hand full but she called all over that she could find out about and came up with a hospital in Huntington WV.  There was where I spent the better part of my life at that time almost 13 years. The doctor Jones said that he would take very good care of me and for my mother not to worry.  So, I was in the hospital and my mother returned home back to Switzer WV to take care of the rest of her family and my dad. My mother didn't drive so once a week she had to find someone to drive her the 68 miles from the house to the hospital. God Bless her and she did come to visit me once a week through rain and snow for those 13 years. Over that span of time I had multiple fractures at a time thus keeping  me in that hospital for all those years. At at the age of 13 my bone condition improved to the point I wasn't braking bones at a height rate. Once I was able to stay home longer mom wanted to move my brother and myself to Orlando Florida where my brother was a gray hound bus driver and was transferred to Orlando. So, she packed us up and off we came to Florida. We went back for a visit after 2 years being in Fla and mom said we are going back to Fla and not returning to WV.  Over the next 50  being in Florida I went to public school and graduated high school and 18 months a trade school in drafting.  I also in that 50 years learned to play the drums and other instruments that I made a decent living at. As as time has gone on a lot of my family members have passed on and now there is one the three left of the original family. The reason for the trip is that my sister are getting up in years and we would like to go visit our home state and go by the relatives grave sites to pay our respects one last time before it will be our time for God to call is home. So so the plan is this as my sister and her daughter and myself would like to make the pilgrimage back home o e more time. Accomplishing that is going to be a major undertaking. We will be looking into taking the train up there on the trip but will still have to rent some type of accessible transportation when we get there. Right now I'm not sure that I will be able to find that special type of transportation that I would need in the small cities of WV.  I think I will have a better chance of renting something out or Orlando. My van is 25 years old and no way making a trip like that. So, no matter what method we use to get there we still need a way to get around and for places that will be accessible to stay over night in. As as you can see I have a lot to work on before March. But none of this can take place without your help. I very know that times are hard for all of us and if you are unable to help please please don't feel bad about it. I have faith in God and if it is His will then it will happen. I want to take this last few minutes to thank you for no matter what you decide to help or not. I have been so Blessed with having you in my life that you already have given a great gift of you being in my life. God Bless each and every one of you.....Michael Ellixson",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/wagjwu3x#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/wagjwu3x#,,,

Over my life time of 46 years ,my teeth have been so fragile that there is little left of them. Also an infection has set in and that means according to the dentist the teeth must all come out. This is going to cost a very large amount of money over and above what my insurance will pay. And it has been recommended that all of my teeth be pulled and to possibly have bone graft so I can then have dental implant dentures put in. As for my vision I have developed Keratoconus a condition in which the clear tissue on the front of the eye (cornea) bulges outward. As of right now and not legally able to drive because of my vision.
I am on Social Security Disability Income and I do have Medicare and some insurance but this will not cover all of this major dental surgery and the bone graft and denture and implants work so I am in hopes, You generous people out there, could help by donating funds so these procedures can be done very soon.

He is 80 pounds now, and at their age it's becoming next to impossible to get him in and out of their SUV.   B and Jim own a beautiful little trailer in Ocean City MD,  and recently B told me they are having to sell her favorite place to afford a wheel chair van.   I just can't allow that to happen.  For even that modest home, B shares! 2 years ago, Cisco and I celebrated our 15 year anniversary there, we had no money for a vacation, but because of her generosity, we were able to get away. I know it is the end of this years giving cycle, but could you possibly find it in your heart to help buy a very necessary handicap van for Carlos?  Any amount, no matter how big or how small will help. I love this lady, she has the biggest, most giving heart of anyone I know.  Help them continue to care for Carlos by donating.  100% of this will go toward a vehicle for them, allowing them to keep their trailer.",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/help-buy-carlos-a-handicap-van#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/help-buy-carlos-a-handicap-van#,,,

Thankfully, she has not had many bone issues as an adult, but she has had more than her fair share of burdensome medical issues that have cost her and her family a lot of money, and not long ago, her job.Beyond spending much of her childhood as an inpatient in traction, her medical and financial troubles have included having an infant with sirenomelia (mermaid syndrome), an abdominal wall defect, and severe pulmonary hypoplasia that resulted in him surviving just 42 minutes after birth.Most recently, more than a year ago, she was involved in a motor vehicle accident where she was T-boned in an intersection. Given her history of OI, they scanned her head-to-toe. The scan revealed a mass near her esophagus and stomach that later had to be removed. Post-operatively, she had a leak at the site of the resection and she subsequently had several complications during that readmission, keeping her in the hospital for more than a month. As her upper GI tract healed, scar tissue formed and left her with a stenotic esophagus such that she has not been able to eat any solid food without vomiting in many months and has lost nearly half of her body weight.She has seen several specialists and was told that the solution was serial esophageal dilations. Her first dilation proceeded without issue, but last week, after she was sent home following the dilation, she felt very unwell and ultimately had to be transported via ambulance back to where her procedure had been done (hours away from her home) due to a bowel perforation. She is expected to remain inpatient for at least another week. She has had procedure after procedure and complication after complication due to this intra-abdominal mass that was found incidentally, and her husband, children, and parents have done their best to be at her side throughout all of this, but it hasn't been easy with school/childcare and work commitments. On top of the medical bills that have been piling up, they have had endless expenses for travel and hotel stays, as well as Erin's loss of income.Despite all of these challenges and her rather poor quality of life over the last year, Erin has maintained great faith and always keeps a smile on her face.  Any monetary donation is appreciated, if you are unable to donate money, prayers are always welcome!",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/help-for-the-cantralls#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/help-for-the-cantralls#,,,

My name is Gaelynn Lea and I am a musician and public speaker from Duluth, MN. I also happen to have a physical disability called osteogenesis imperfecta, or Brittle Bones Disease. Due to numerous fractures in utero, I have bent arms and legs, which cause me to have a shortened stature. I have never walked, but I started using an electric wheelchair when I was two and a half years old.  I have been playing violin for over 20 years, in large part thanks to a creative music teacher who helped me to adapt my style of playing. I hold my violin upright in my wheelchair like a tiny cello instead of on my shoulder. In 2006 I joined my first band, in 2011 I wrote my first original song, and in March of 2016 I won NPR Music's Tiny Desk Contest.  

(Video of my Tiny Desk Concert)Now I am a full-time touring musician with the help of my husband Paul, who travels with me. Winning the Tiny Desk Contest opened up a whole new world of opportunities for me and I am so grateful for the adventures Paul and I have had so far this year!(Pictures of Paul and me)A Wonderful Adventure Awaits this December! But it turns out this year's adventures aren't quite done yet! Earlier this fall I got an offer to perform in Prague as a guest artist with the band ""The Tap Tap "" for their Christmas concert on December 6th - some of the artists in this group also have disabilities and they do a lot of performing and advocacy in the Czech Republic. They said they could provide airfare for both of us and hotels for two nights, so my husband Paul and I gladly accepted the offer! But it doesn't end there...(Picture of The Tap Tap)Aside from performing solo sets, I also play in a band called The Murder of Crows with Alan Sparhawk of Low.  It just so happens that Low will be doing a Christmas tour in Europe around the Prague show is happening. When Alan found out that Paul and I were headed to Prague, he made the very generous offer to have me open  for Low at three of their shows - Belfast, UK on December 12th, Dublin, Ireland on December 13th, and Kilkenny, Ireland on December 14th! This was also very exciting turn of events and Paul and I once again accepted the offer. (Picture of Low's Christmas Tour Poster)After it became clear that this Europe trip was for sure happening, I worked on adding at least one more show for good measure - so I will also be playing at The Windmill Brixton  in London, England on December 7th!(Picture of The Windmill, Brixton)These were all very exciting developments indeed... I have never been overseas and the idea of traveling with my music is literally a dream come true! I immediately began to prepare for the trip... We got our passports and scheduled the airline tickets and began to research transportation options once in Europe.(Picture of my new passport!)Overcoming Travel BarriersBut as we began to make our travel plans, I realized that it wasn't going to be possible to travel with my electric wheelchair due to the age and inaccessibility of the buildings and infrastructure in Europe. This meant that we would need to find another travel companion to go with Paul and me in order to make the logistics feasible. I am unable to push a manual wheelchair, so I need a lot more help with mobility when that's my only mode of transportation. Having traveled this way before, we knew that Paul would not be able to carry all our luggage, my instrument, and handle my wheelchair simultaneously. It would be too dangerous.So in order to make this trip as safe and efficient as possible, we decided to ask our friend Leah Nelson to go on  this trip with us. She is a very special friend to me - we go back 10 years now! She is not only the person who suggested that I start teaching fiddle lessons, but she also is the woman who filmed my Tiny Desk Contest submission video... So on a personal note, it means a lot to me to have her join us on this adventure.  (Pictures of Leah and me)However, once we asked Leah to come with us, the financial reality of this trip began to set in... Although this is truly the opportunity of a lifetime, we won't be earning nearly enough to cover all the expenses. We are committed to making it work either way, but it would mean a lot for us not to go into debt or drain our savings in December - I am a full-time independent musician after all! Finances are tight and paychecks are never guaranteed.That is why I am asking YOU, the people who support my music and my mission, to help make this trip a reality for us.  If you could donate to our upcoming tour in Europe, we would be so grateful! We have pretty accurate estimate of $5,000 for all expenses.I am incredibly excited about the adventures that await us overseas, but the reality is that none of this would be doable without support. As an artist with a disability I can travel, but the assistance of others is absolutely necessary. This need for extra assistance can pose some additional barriers, but so far we've always figured out a way to make it work... I am confident this European tour will be no exception! (Picture of me performing in Oakland, California)So, how much money do we need to raise?First, here's what is already covered: * 2 round-trip tickets for me & Paul from MN to Prague * 2 nights of hotel in Prague - December 5 & 6* 3 nights of hotel in Ireland & UK - December 12-14Here's what we still need to cover:* 1 ticket for Leah from Prague to Minneapolis: $1,250* 3 tickets from Prague to London: $250  * 2 nights of hotel in London (December 7 & 8): $400* 3 tickets from London to Dublin (December 9): $400* 3 nights of hotel in Dublin (December 9-11th): $600* 3 tickets to Prague from Dublin (December 15): $300* Transportation in UK & Ireland: $400* 2 nights of hotel in Prague (December 15 & 16): $400* Food for 3 people 13 days: $1,000 GOAL FOR THE EUROPEAN TOUR: $5,000 Even if we don't meet our goal, any amount raised will help take off the financial pressure for us. We truly appreciate any support you can provide for this special Christmas tour.  If for some reason we exceed our goal, I will save the extra funds for the production costs of my next full-length album, which I am hoping to record in the Fall and Winter of 2017.Why this trip matters to me.I think it's important for the world to see artists with disabilities succeeding in their chosen fields. Sometimes this requires additional planning or support, but I believe these obstacles don't have to stop us. I am grateful for the opportunity to spread the word about disability awareness and inclusion wherever I speak or perform... This trip will be another chance to do just that.  (Picture of me performing at a graduation ceremony)Want to learn more about my work?I love to perform music and speak about disability awareness... Check out the videos below to watch me in action:

(Video of one of my Disability Awarness speeches)I believe that music has the ability to unite us and to remind us of the beauty in the world... I am grateful for the opportunity to bring my music to other countries and to promote the concepts of equality and creative expression for all.

We are the Walton’s and we would like to start off by saying thank you all for even just stopping in to hear our story. For years my wife and I have struggled with our health and pushed ourselves to makes sure we did everything we could to provide for our daughter. I would like to start off by listing our health problems to give a bit of insight into why things have been harder for us than most people to accomplish goals and dreams.   First of our miracle child, our angel, is healthy other than the occasional cavity and whatnot of most children she is healthy but the stress has definitely been affecting her which breaks my heart. We love her so much and we both would work ourselves into the grave to give her everything she needs.   My wife on the other hand has a walking disorder that has yet to be determined, a swollen pituitary gland, TMJ, and a growth to the right of her heart which may or may not be the cause of her breathing issues. The Pituitary has been monitored for ten years now with no one wanting to even investigate if it is a tumor or just swollen. They say it is inactive except she is having abnormal periods that happen around the same time each month just have trouble starting and play the off on off on game throughout. We recently went to ECMC and have been told she could go blind if she becomes pregnant so just don't become pregnant, As far as her walking they told us she is thirty years old why does it matter now what the cause is and why should they take the time to figure it out. I mean wow that was devastating to her that both a neurosurgeon and neurologist both have refused to help due to her age (only 30!!!). She is in constant pain with her back molars which dentists refuse to remove even when one is almost completely filling. The TMJ has been a very slow and painful process with little if any improvement. So most days my wife is stuck in bed because she is in pain from one place or the other. She feels she is missing out on our daughters life because she cannot do things that the other moms can because of the pain. Needless to say she cannot work. We have to get her down to Cleveland Clinic because we have tried every doctor in our network and this last on gives us the attitude of why should I care and that my wife has lived her life already.     A little background on myself I am Texan born and raised. I have worked hard most of my life but in 2009 I suffered a severe sprain fracture on my left ankle and was advised that with having osteogenesis Imperfecta (brittle bones disease) I need to find a desk job and avoid manual labor. In January of 2013 I started my Computer Repair business so just celebrated five years. In 2015 I graduated with My BA degree in Business Information Systems minoring in Criminal Justice. 2016 I started back on my Masters Degree in Criminal Justice specializing in Cyber Crime and Technology which I have maintained a 4.0 throughout now in my capstone course and will be graduating here in June. I am currently in two honor societies as well. I am a troop leader for my daughters Girl Scout troop. I am also a school recruiter for Girl Scouts of Western New York, Website administrator for our Girl Scout service unit, and Product Manager for the Service Unit as well. So some weeks I spend a lot of hours volunteering for Girl Scouts. I also volunteer in my daughters classroom several times a month at least five our six most months. All I ask for nothing in return because it is volunteer work and I love to help out in the community. After graduation I am stuck between expanding my own business or going to work for a law enforcement agency to catch sex traffickers and child predators.     Now for the bad stuff. October 31, 2013 heard my back pop and was unable to move for hours after being taken by ambulance to the hospital. I have a collapsed disc pinching a nerve in my back that is a constant pain for me. After that I was diagnosed with type II diabetes, which is a struggle, then was diagnosed with sleep apnea and narcolepsy with cataplexy. Needless to say the last few years have been a struggle but we have pushed ourselves. Now we have reached our breaking point though. My narcolepsy I feel has become worse I struggle to stay awake during the day more and at night I struggle to get more than a couple of hours a night which by Friday I am just going through the motions and Saturday or Sunday I crash but only for six to eight hours. I live in constant pain from the brittle bones and the cataplexy. My wife and I are forced to balance tasks around the house as we can just to accomplish even basic tasks like taking the dog out and feeding the animals.   I guess our financial bad luck started back in December where I had a little money saved up and decided to invest in a Snow blower which is a most have here around Buffalo, NY. Especially with brittle bones and the collapsed disc, shoveling is just no longer a viable option. Only New Year’s Day the thing breaks where the auger will not engage and squeals. Warranty company wants me to load it up and drive thirty miles away and drop it off for who knows how long to get it fixed. Yea ok I can’t lift the thing and my tailgate is broken where it won’t come down and I have a covered bed. For months we have kind of lived a month behind on bills as with most years we were hoping to get caught up in tax season. Unfortunately, last month we had the alternator go out in our vehicle, the brakes had to be replaced on the front both sides, and this month my driver side mirror just fell off and shattered on the driveway. That was two heavy expenses and a cheaper expense since the glass was all that broke on the mirror. I still have to fix my tailgate as it will no longer come down and replace most of the tires one is almost completely bald.     Overall the funds collected here will help us to get current on out utility bills. Honestly we hate asking for any kind of help from anyone but right now we are getting shutoff notices for our utilities including the internet which I need for school since I go online and for running my home based business. I definitely would like more so that we can get tires of the truck and repair the tail gate as well as be able to pay for my cap and gown for graduation and my graduation fee so I can actually graduate when I get done with my courses. We really feel ashamed to even be asking for help but right now we are stuck and facing shut offs for multiple utilities that we need. We need the funds buy the end of the month for sure.Thank you everyone from the bottom of or hearts.",,,https://www.gofundme.com/hapac-help-getting-out-of-a-hole#,,,

On June 1st 2015 I woke up just like any other morning and was getting ready to be lifted out of bed and be put into my Wheelchair. As my Caregiver was lifting me I heard a pop followed by excruciating pain, my right femur broke. Just by the pressure of having her arm under my leg and pulling me towards her body to cradle me like a baby would be held, caused my femur bone to snap. I laid there for 3 hours trying to decide wether I should go to the hospital for x-Rays or just stay in my bed where I thought I was comfortable. Finally my sisters and mom called the ambulance and I was taken to the hospital. There they did the X-Rays and found that I broke my femur in half. I got to come home from the hospital after 4 days and laid in bed at home for 8 weeks. Now for me to be safe transferring in and out of bed, I need to purchase a Hoyer Lift and Sling. Of course my insurance doesn't see it as something I need and won't cover it. So now I'm asking everyone I know, if they can help me raise the funds to afford a Hoyer Lift and Sling, so I can transfer safely out of bed and into my chair and from my chair into the shower, without breaking something else.

Many of you know Julian Gonzalez for his vocal talents, his huge personality and spirit of fun. You may also know that he recently certified as a USGTF Golf Instructor and has been working alongside his family at Bluff Pointe Golf Course as he competes. What you not know is that Julian has suffered from osteogenesis imperfecta or Brittle Bone Disease which is a genetic problem that creates easily fractured bones. Last week, Julian had a serious accident at the course in which he suffered a burst fracture of his Spine and a complex fracture of his Left arm. The capable Trauma and Neurosurgical teams at CRMC have stabilized his spine and will be turning to his arm soon. The surgeries were lengthy and very very complex. They were successful in that they have preserved his spinal cord and the surgeons are hoping that Julian won’t lose too much trunk mobility. Rehabilitation will be long and very involved. Although Julian has insurance, he will have non-covered medical and living expenses and no income for a while. I am reaching out to our Buchanan Hs, Fresno and Clovis community in the hopes that we can help Julian out with some of those uncovered expenses.

I was born with osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 3. This disease makes my bones brittle. I have broken my legs over 30 times and I have had about 20 surgeries including a scoliosis correction surgery. I grew up with constant fractures and having to miss a lot of school. I was bullied for having to use a wheelchair. The past sat few years have been really rough though. It started with a scoliosis surgery to fix a 65 degree angle in my spine.Then one morning I woke up with a right broken hip and left broken femur. Just from sleeping. I had to get a new rod in my left femur and they tried to fix my hip with pains. A month later the pins got displaced because the hip was broken into too many pieces. I had to go back into surgery to have my hip completely removed. Doctors don’t believe my brittle bones can handle a hip replacement so there is literally nothing connecting my right leg to my pelvic bone.Then I healed from that but lost a lot of my walking ability. I stood up from my wheelchair to sit on the couch and my tibia broke and I broke the rod in the tibia. My doctor tried to make it a minor surgery by just putting a plate over the fracture. 6 months later the plate did not allow the leg to heal so I had a non-union fracture. A new doctor with experience with OI had me go under another surgery to removed the rod and replace the rod. I am still healing and the break is still there.Because of all these medical reasons, I had to quit my job at Mcdonald’s where I had to stand for 8+ hours. My body physically couldn’t handle it. I have been to multiple job interviews since then for jobs that I could do from my wheelchair but no one has hired me. I currently live off $750 a month from the government. Rent is $400 then utilities cost around $150. That leaves me with $200 each month for extra things such as groceries. My absolute DREAM is to see Ed Sheeran at the Rose Bowl this summer in LA. With airfare, hotel, and the concert ticket, I obviously can’t afford it. I just got a new customized wheelchair which I have expenses for plus all of my other medical treatments. I’d also love to see Harry Styles in LA in a few weeks. I know this is really soon but Harry’s music has helped me get through a lot of my fractures and surgeries. I know it isn’t likely but I’m reaching out to anyone who can even spare a dollar. I’ll be putting it towards paying off my medical bills and hopefully getting to see Ed Sheeran at the Rose Bowl. If you can do anything to help I’d really appreciate it. I don’t normally ask for help but since my health is declining and I can barely walk like I used to, I want to get the dream to come true before I physically can’t make it anymore. I made an Instagram if you’d like to see pictures of me and all my surgeries/fractures. The username is @oisam95 which is the same as my Twitter. I know $800 is outrageous but any little bit helps.Thank you so much! -SamMy instagram!",,,https://www.gofundme.com/helpingsamout#,,,

I was born with a genetic bone disease called osteogenesis Imperfects type 3. If you're interested in more information you can click to here .  O.I. Causes a form of dwarfism because of the changes to bone growth so I'm 3'3” and never been able to walk.Before I was 21 I had broken around one hundred bones and had 17 surgeries. I use an electric wheelchair to get around since I've never been able to walk. At some point about 10 years ago my breathing issues, including sleep apnea, got worse so I applied for and received Social Security Disability. It sucked to have to go on Disability especially since I worked for 9 years as a computer programmer, but my breathing issues made it to hard to do it anymore. Anyway, recently Social Security decided to “Reevaluate” my disability claim, I guess to make sure my O.I. Hadn't spontaneously cured itself and I grew to 6'2” and was now running marathons. It's going to be a couple months before my re-certification is complete, but in the mean time my disability checks have been suspended so I'm without a way to pay rent, pay for groceries or much else. When I was told my checks were being held until the reevaluation was complete I was a tad bit angry... Ok... I was hopping mad since I have no other income, as meager as it is. Added to that I'm going to be needing a new wheelchair soon since my current chair is 9 years old and I use it to go everywhere. Medicare will pay for 80% of the cost, but since an electric wheelchair can cost upwards of $15,000 for a good reliable chair, I'm looking at a few thousand dollars to get a new chair and that doesn't count the added cost of the lift seating system I need to be able to do daily activities like shopping for groceries and such. The lift seat system is considered a luxury so medicare/medicaid won't pay for it. I really try to do as much as I can daily and having the lift seat would make things so much easier.Derek said he'd create a GoFundMe to help me pay bills til my disability is reinstated and once I'm reinstated I'll get reimbursed for the checks being held. Then I can use the money raised to allow me to pay for the new wheelchair and the lift seat addition.Once I've paid for the new chair we'll be donating any left over money to Chicago ADAPT. This is a disability rights organization that works to improve the lives of the disabled. They do work placement, housing, and work with State and Federal legislators to help those with a disability live as independently as possible.

She has been fighting medical issues since she was about 4 years old. After many years of struggling with multiple medical problems and needing answers, she finally was admitted to the Pediatric Diagnostic Center at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. ￼ The specialists determined she has a total of 8 diseases. Shania's diseases are Gastroparesis, Autonomic Dysfunction with P.O.T.S, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, May-Thurner Syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, Anemia, Asthma, and Celiac Disease. Some of the complications caused by these diseases include fevers,  migraines, fatigue, severe joint pain, dizziness, blood pressure issues, and heart complications, as well as broken bones, choking, vomiting, and paralysis of the stomach.  ￼ Shania is my hero!  Excerpts from “Normal” - by Shania Prosoco (Which she won a Young Author's Award for in her city): What is “normal”? Does it even exist? I’m not sure. Maybe for some people, normal is waking up in the morning to a maid making breakfast, while for others, it’s waking up in the morning not knowing if you will even get breakfast. For me, “normal” is taking medications, being at hospitals, waking up in the morning not knowing if I will be in pain or if I will feel sick. ￼ Some people might feel bad for me after hearing my story. They might think my life is hard, but the truth is, I love my life. Yes, I have things that I have to deal with as everyone does, but you can’t just sit around and feel bad about things that you have to deal with. If you can’t change the situation and what you have to deal with, you just live your life, and enjoy it. ￼ There are so many things to appreciate in this world. I never want my medical complications to take me down. I want to overcome and have a good life: laugh, have fun, just enjoy the life I am living because it could be so much worse. I am so very blessed and grateful to have the “normal” that I do. I have to manage life-threatening diseases every day, and sometimes it gets scary. Even though my “normal” holds difficulties, I feel very thankful for what my “normal” is. Everyone has things that they have to deal with. It’s all about how you handle it, even if it can be very difficult at times. ￼ So, my name is Shania. I am 13 years old, and I am living a great life. I love my life, and I am very happy with what I have in my life, and who I am living it with. I am so thankful for who I have become because of all I have had to go through and continue to go through every day. I know I will accomplish anything I put my mind to, in spite of my complications. ￼ I have always wanted to be “normal”, to feel “normal”, but I am not “normal”. I am so much more than “normal”. ￼ Shania is in need, now, for your help. She needs to move to North Carolina from New Mexico to get the medical attention she now needs from Duke Children's and specialists located there to better manage her health long term.  Getting her those specialists is what will give Shania the best shot. Shania’s family needs about  $15, 000 to afford to move across country, afford all of Shania's out of pocket perscriptions (Shania has 7 medications) , and all of out of pocket expenses for specialists until they qualify for insurance there. Shania's prescriptions and specialist without insurance are very expensive, but she cannot have gaps of not being seen because of how severe her health issues are and can become. ￼ Thank you for your consideration in sharing or donating to this GoFundMe.

I'm a 20 year old disabled, trans/queer person of color. As anyone would be, I'm not really one to ask for help or money, but I'm desperately in need of help! All my life I've been in some type of an abusive living environment. But specifically, the reason I'm making this page is this: I was sexually abused for years by my sister when I was younger, which I finally had the courage to tell my mother about in early 2013. Recently my sister and her husband planned to move back in with my mother and I since they were going to move back to our city. When I found out, I told my mother it would be extremely triggering for me, but despite that, she allowed them to move in with us anyway. Within a few days of being forced to live and interract with my rapist, I started having bad panic attacks, being that I suffer from Anxiety Disorder, and there wasn't anything I could do to stop all of the flash backs. So my fiance and I thought it would be best if I left the house. I've been staying with my best friend and her mom since mid/late April, but they'll only be able to house me until the end of the month of May because of their financial situation.Since moving out, my mother - who's very manipulative, and has been abusive physically, verbally, and mentally towards me all my life - has said most of all of this is my fault because I didn't come stay with my friend sooner. She's stolen over $200 from me now, and she has implied that I'm lying about the abuse that I suffered from my sister, claiming that what I told her is nothing but ""alligations, until I can prove it,"" which troubles me since she's a rape survivor herself.I have one other place I can go for the next few months (until mid July), but after that is where I need serious help! There's no way that I can go back to live with my mother; the environment there is toxic and bad for my mental health. Since she's disabled as well, my sister will be over at her house almost everyday to assist her (even though my sister and her husband have moved out into their own place now). My sister is abusive towards me even now. She's very ableist, and transphobic. She assulted me around the time I came out as trans, aggeresively pulling the neck of my shirt down to expose my binder after saying I looked ""too flat chested."" My mother, sister, and brother-in-law make almost no effort to respect or acknowledge my gender identity, and often use very hateful, transphobic slurs around/towards me.This whole ordeal - ever since telling my mother about it back in 2013 I got very suicidal that year, and almost lost all hope - but even now it's taken a toll on my mental health. I can assure you that I don't have any intentions of hurting myself now, but given everything I know it would not be safe for me to live there. I plan on trying to get into some low-income housing as my condition -Osteogenisis imperfecta- has me wheelchair-bound and makes it difficult to work. I plan on applying for SSI and other types of assistance, but the applications will take several months to process. I've set a goal of $2000, which is an estemation. I just need something to help me get an apartment, food, and cover general living expenses (i.e. rent, utilities, etc.) until the applications go through and I can get back on my feet. The only other housing option I have is a shelter in my city which I wouldn't prefer as I would have to keep my trans status private since it's a shelter for women and I'm set to start school in the fall, and I'd really like a stable living situation for that.Again, please donate what you can, every dollar helps. If you can't, please pass this page along. Thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart! -Nik",,,https://www.gofundme.com/94nwhg#,,,

To correct her severe bowing and constantly deforming legs, she had titanium telescoping rods surginally inserted into all four long leg bones when she was two years old. These rods also act as an internal splint, and help keep small fractures from being spiral fractures. In 2014 alone she has had two surgeries, and another one coming up in November. Her first surgery, in January, was to have every single tooth capped. Sierra’s teeth are brittle like her bones, and were crumbling to the point she could not chew food. Our only option was to cap her baby teeth, to reinforce them. Due to her OI and DI (Dentinogenesis imperfecta) – we had to take her to a Specialist at UNC Dental School. Our insurance company refused to bill the surgery medically – even though we had letters from the Dentist stating it was medically necessary, and not for cosmetic reasons. Sierra was put to sleep, and had white caps put on the front four teeth – top and bottom rows; and the rest are silver – princess teeth. After our dental insurance paid, we still owe almost $3,000.00 on that surgery alone. Until we pay the bill in full, she cannot see her dentist again, and she has two new molars that need to be capped - and a sensitive tooth that we need to have addressed.Sierra’s second surgery, in February, was to replace the titanium rods in both of her tibias. She has these rods to help strengthen her bones, and to reduce the amount of deforming and bowing her bones are able to do. We were originally supposed to replace her tibial and femoral rods – but due to a FDA issue – the rods we needed weren’t available at the time of surgery. We had to change our plan, and put rods we wouldn’t normally use in her tibias – and didn’t touch her femurs. The surgery was supposed to be very short – at the max 2 hours. After it was all said and done surgery lasted almost 8 hours. There were various complications with sierra’s bone quality, and Dr. Frick had to figure some things out as they went. Sierra’s surgeon is now located in Orlando, FL – so every time she needs surgery we have to get us both there and back. OI is a rare disorder, and Dr. Frick is the only surgeon near us that I trust to operate on Sierra’s legs. It’s not like it’s her tonsils, or something – it’s her legs! Her ability to walk or be stuck in a wheelchair all the time. Wouldn’t you get the best doctor for your child? I ended up using all of my personal time and some vacation time for this trip/surgery/recovery.I had surgery in April, and then went to work the next day against doctors’ orders, so that I wouldn’t miss work. Only to then catch two different stomach bugs this summer that cost me a day of vacation each time.We leave for our Make A Wish trip October 27 – November 2nd. What should be an exciting, relaxing family vacation has turned into something that haunts me every day.November 3rd is Sierra’s 6th Birthday. Thanks to a very generous donation from a friends family, of a week at their condo - my parents will get to stay in Orlando with me - which means they will get to be with me for this surgery! I did it alone in February, and it was one of the hardest things I have ever done - physically, and emotionally. The next day, one day after she turns six – Sierra will be having surgery again, in Orlando. This time to switch the rods in both femurs and both tibias. This surgery will be a hard one. It will be the longest, and most evasive she has ever gone through. Anytime we touch the femurs is a tough surgery, and recovery. Not to mention, she may need a blood transfusion due to all the osteomies. She will either fly home with long leg splints on, or in a spica cast. Sierra will require heavy pain medication through an IV to manage her pain the first few days. Please pray that we can control her pain at all times. Unfortunately, because of the other surgeries and issues we have faced this year, I dont have enough paid time off to cover Sierra's trip, surgery, and recovery. I will at the very least miss a months worth of pay, if not more. Not to mention that all of this will be happening a month before Christmas.Those missed checks will be a huge crush to our family’s already hard hit income this year. Without assistance, we could potentially lose our house. So, here I am – pouring out my fears. Asking for prayers, good vibes- whatever you believe – whomever you pray to – for my family, for my daughter, and for me. This will be the third time this year I will watch my baby be put under, only to wake up in pain, and without her mobility. I also ask for donations, if you can. And for you guys to share this page. Thank you for reading, and the prayers. This year has been the biggest test I have ever lived through – and I would really like to pass this one.Jessica",Updates   42,https://www.gofundme.com/HelptheScogginsBullisFam#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/HelptheScogginsBullisFam#,,,

It results in bones that break easily, been transported to Morgantown where they will continue to try and save this precious life, test after test, bleeding on the brain, and seizer's. The doctors and nurses are working on the clock for this baby, and so am I. A social worker has put Stephany ( baby's mother) and myself in a hotel for now. We are on the waiting list for the Ronald McDonald house. There are 4 families ahead of us. Zoey has a family behind her. Unforntually we are about out of money. The hospital will not let us stay in the hospital due to HIPPAA regulations. I will sleep in my vehicle if I have to, but hopefully with help we can stay in a hotel and be showered and clean to return to the hospital with Zoey. She didn't ask for this and her condition was not due to any foul play. This condition is either passed down or is diagnosed as rare as 1 in 200,000 children. Poor Zoey will never be able to do a lot of things most children get to do. She will never have children, or walk, or be able to do the little things most people do without thinking about like pull their self up. She will be placed in a wheel chair at a very young age.  We as her family will continue to fight for this precious gift and do anything we can to help and protect her.

Though the OI disease has now eliminated Rick's ability to work daily it is important that he continue driving. Driving is a great form of excercise and is his only freedom.  His present van no longer provides the safe or secure travel any person needs, let alone one with brittle bones. A replacement van will cost close to $70,000. Rick has now purchased a Ford Transit van after testing several other modified vehicles.  Delivery is scheduled for the end of April or mid May.

lol).  I don’t need to return for 6 months, and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.So here’s where I am today…The pain in my back from the fractures continues (and will, unfortunately, always be there to some extent).  I can’t (and shouldn’t) lift my Jack, who just keeps growing!, which means I still can’t care for him by myself.  We had to put him in daycare full time when he was 10 months old, but luckily he loves it.  I can walk unassisted most days inside my house, and very short distances using a walker.  But other than that, I need to use my wheelchair. Social Security Disability has denied me 3 times since I applied in February last year, and the soonest I can expect to present my case before a judge is August of 2017.  We have spent down our entire savings just to make ends meet and make sure we don’t lose our home, but it has become clear that despite my disability and pain, the only viable option is to try and return to work in some capacity. I can drive, but I can’t get my wheelchair in and out of my car because it is so heavy.  Because my condition is really only going to worsen in the coming years, I need a wheelchair accessible van.  But they are expensive… far more expensive than a regular van.My dear friend Kelleigh offered to start this campaign to help raise money for a down payment on an accessible van so that I can hopefully reintegrate myself into the work force and continue my career as an occupational therapist.  I deeply appreciate you taking the time to read my story…please know that any amount is SO appreciated, and it will be put directly toward an accessible van.  Thank you so much,- Sarah",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/codingtonfund#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/codingtonfund#,,,

We met through the wonderful organization Hearts4Refugees and have ""adopted"" the family.Pictured are three of Mohammed and Qamar Haj Hamad's four children (the youngest did not cooperate for the photo!). Ahmad, to the right of his four year old younger sister Mais is actually 7 years old. He was born with osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bone disease. His bones fractures easily and his growth is severely affected. The older two children are in school and Mohammad and Qamar are looking forward to starting English classes this month. They have been so touched by the generosity of our community. I made a small wish list (they did not ask for much) for household items they needed and this was fulfilled within a day by my dear friends at Ali's school. I am hoping to raise funds for them to help with rent of their small apartment and repairs to his donated car as well as other expenses that come up along the way until Mohammad is able to find work. As you can imagine the major barriers are language, lack of references, and his son's medical condition and the care that involves. Also, for any of you that are local if you have any advice regarding work Mohammad could find please let me know. He has an engineering degree but is willing to do anything that will support his family. They are such a sweet family, we truly feel privileged to be a part of their lives.Addendum: I have been asked to give specific examples of how donations will be spent- just a couple of weeks ago Mohammad's car broke down on the way to the hospital with his son. He rented a car to get him to and from the hospital the next few days. The repairs for his car will be $900. He also wishes to buy some items like a laptop and a cell phone for his wife. In addition he needs help covering his rent until he is able to find a job. I'm hoping this amount will keep the family under a roof until he is employed. The organization Hearts4Refugees suggested that I give the family money gradually as needs arise rather than in one bulk amount and this is what I intend to do.Much love,The Fehmis (Nadia, Abbas, Ali and Saniya)",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/help-the-haj-hamad-family#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/help-the-haj-hamad-family#,,,

I’ve had 2 surgeries which left me with thousands of dollars indebt. The first surgery was a staff infection on a metal rod in my forearm. The other was my opposite elbow that developed a mysterious blood clot. I’ve since fractured my thigh/hip, that at that time, cost me time from work. I then, partially tore my 2 shoulders and just recently I woke up with my right leg not functioning properly. I am wheelchair bound and additionally have severe scoliosis which keeps me from sitting for long periods of time and does not allow me to work anymore. I am just trying to get back to square one.

My ears need funding.,Cochlear implant,,,,,Adult,Self,,,210,"For those of you who know me, you know i've struggled with hearing loss since I was 12 years old. I have a very rare bone disease called Osteogensis Imperfects (say that ten times fast). It has a lot of unpleasant side effects but i've found the hearing loss to be the worst yet. I was declared legally deaf in 2011, and after much of a personal battle, I finally found myself ready to pursue a cochlear implant this past June. I was lucky enough to be found an appropriate candidate for the implant and it was implanted in me in this August! There are misconceptions about a cochlear implant, it's beneficial but not a miracle cure, it is also extremely expensive. My surgery and device, combined cost around $83,000. Luckily I have amazing insurance that has helped me greatly, and I am so appreciative. However, we are still left with an out of pocket payment for around $7,000. That is minimal in comparison to the full cost of the surgery, but still an amount for a three person, one income family to be intimidated by. I feel very fortunate to have finally had my implant installed and I am very hopeful that I will regain some of my hearing in the next few months, be able to hear my daughter's voice again, things others take for granted. With this gift though, has come guilt, worrying about how this will affect my family financially and it is scary. If anyone could see their way to helping our family pay for this gift, I would be forever apprecitive of you. Any donation helps. I wish someone would have told me how expensive it is to be disabled. Thanks for taking your time to read this. Much love,Holly.",,,https://www.gofundme.com/2pdxr6es#,,,

I also have asthma so laying down a lot can set up pneumonia. im a very stubborn person so I don't like asking for help but I truly would like to be more independent and use my power chair less, which I can only use now in public for long distances due to it being to big for my house and very difficult to unload, and have people pushing me less even if you cant donate please just share my story with others I know that not everyone can help but just sharing helps too!!! :) God bless you all <3",Updates   11,https://www.gofundme.com/6q3uu8#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/6q3uu8#,,,

For the past 8 years I have been living with several medical problems and dealing with procedures and surgeries, both good and bad. For example:  Minor day surgery to remove staph infection, which turned from a 30 minute operation to two hours. Part one of a two stage surgery for hemorrhoids, for which I am still at pain when I sit down. I had surgery to remove a mole and the surgeon broke my eye socket. I have had a brittle bone disease since adolescence, and it has only gotten worse with age. A botched dental surgery to remove all of my teeth. Unfortunately, the dentist broke my jaw in 10 different places and left broken roots from the teeth in the jaw bone. After 2 years being on basically a liquid diet I was forced to seek reconstructive surgery, in order to rebuild my upper and lower jaws.                  For over 7 years I have had no teeth or dentures, have not been able to eat anything hard or crunchy, and can only process soft or very tender food. No nuts, chips, fried food, etc. (I dream of fried chicken sometimes.)                 Adding to this, I am allergic to most fruits. This past decade has been a living nightmare, but compared to this year, it has been a breeze. If these, and the rest of my issues, were the only things plaguing my life, I would not be writing to you. It takes the greatest humility to share my situation, and I hope that you will at least listen.                  This is my situation now. About 10 months ago my health started to go downhill at an exorbitant rate. Slowly at first, but steadily worse to the point of alarm. I have been to several doctors, and things are still getting worse on a daily basis, but here is what I know at this current moment.  I have an enlarged heart Irregular heartbeat Heart palpitations Tachycardia (heart racing)  Possible blockage in arteries Constant chest pain Constant migrainesTinnitus (ringing in ears)Tendinitis Bursitis Arthritis Vertigo lasting up to 3-4 days (unable to eat or hold down any food or water, and cannot move with vertigo) Past due for 2nd stage surgery for hemorrhoids (daily bleeding internally and externally) Chronic muscle pain Headaches InsomniaDepression (Both clinical, and from my situation) Nausea Severe fatigue Muscle cramps and/or spasms, etc. Loss of lung capacityDecreased mobility (can only walk slowly for short distances [less than 10 mins.] before I have to sit down and rest, or lay down from one to four hours.) I use a cane to help me stand, walk and balance I have lost most strength and function of the right side of my body. Suffering extreme chronic pain Sharp knife-like pain in every single joint and most of the muscles on the right side of body ( hand, arm shoulder, neck, entire spine, hip and knee, ect) Unable to lift more than 2 lbs. with right arm Unable to lift more than 20 lbs. with left arm Unable to stand using right knee and hip (That is why I must have a cane) EXTREME continuous pain Stress Fatigue Loud noises, (IE: Knock on door) bring on full body muscle spasms that repeatedly shake my entire body. These can last from a few hours to a couple of days Bright lights can cause the same reaction, making driving at night impossibleSevere neck and back pain (grinding bone to bone in neck). Loss of sensitivity to skin, with traveling numbness Unknown bruising, cuts and scabs. I cannot feel them or remember how I got them. Random bleeding from unknown places. (IE: Sometimes I will look down and my shirt or pants will be covered in blood, but I have no visible wounds I can find.)About 2-3 times a month my trachea tube restricts and I can't swallow water without severe pain. It makes it impossible to swallow solid food at all. This will last in upwards of 3-4 days (liquid diet only). In less than 2 months I went from 215 lbs. to 140 lbs. (loss 75 lbs.) before I could stop losing weight. I’m about 145 lbs. and holding for now.                  Four months ago this malady (whatever it may be) started to spread into my left side of my body as well, much to my abject terror. Everything listed above has been caused, or affects only my right hand side, but with this new revelation, I fear I will soon lose all use in my left side, and become incapacitated altogether. I am losing the ability to take care of daily necessities. Washing cloths in a reasonable manner has become impossible, as the laundry basket is too heavy for me carry to laundry room. I wash dishes in stages because I am unable to stand for any useful length of time before I am wracked with pain and muscle cramps/spasms. I cannot clean or doing anything has the same result. Even when taking a shower I am forced to rest. The thought of this spreading to the rest of my body is unconscionable.                 At my last doctor appointment over 10 months ago, my blood pressure was 215 over 110 with a pulse of 117, the same average reading I took 3-4 times a week. Now, however, my blood pressure average has been between 145-215 over 100-115, with a pulse always being over 100 at rest.                 I have been becoming more confused lately, with worrying trouble problems thinking, concentrating and focusing. I cannot remember anything without extreme difficulty. My ability to tell time is almost useless. I think 4 or 5 days have gone by, but in reality it has been more like 7 or 9 did. I have been blacking out, loosing sporadic pieces of time. Sometimes I cannot tell what has just happened, or what I need to do next. This is growing worse and more frequent.                 For the past 8 years I have lived alone in an old 27’ 1969 Holiday Rambler travel trailer (my cave) with two small dogs to keep me company. They have been my salvation and my sanity. I’m currently 3 months behind on my rent. I have no propane to cook with, nor any hot water to shower with. What food I have in my trailer is it. I am down to eating old military rations I saved after Hurricane Ike.                 Two weeks ago, due to all the heavy rain in SE Texas, my trailer sprung several leaks in the ceiling. By bathroom currently has no protection, and any rain at all comes cascading down the wall like a water fall. Mold has begun to spring up, but I am physically unable to clean it, even if I had the supplies. If this is not repaired, I will lose my only place to live. I’m physically unable to make repairs.                 I have no car insurance and the tags are expired. My car is 13 years old with an oil leak in the motor, power steering leak, bad tires and over 225,000 miles. When the occasion comes that I am able to secure a doctor’s appointment, I won't be able to afford the gas to drive there.                I have worked contract in the construction industry for over 30 years. I am a hard worker and have always stridden to be honest with my employers and my fellow workers. I am smart, competent, and have a charisma with people that usually serves me well. Though I have no formal education, I learn quickly and pick up any job fast. I have never relied on anyone for anything, but have always managed to do it myself. If I didn't have the means, I did without. I have been a manager for more companies than I can name, and I never bring my personal issues to the work place.                 Back in October 2014, I took a few of weeks off work due to the flu. I quickly realized, however, that while I was over the flu, there was something much more sinister wrong with my body. I called my boss on a Tuesday to tell him I was still under a doctor’s care but I would call him on Thursday and let him know the results. I was told that would be fine, and foolishly, I believed them.                 The next day I awoke to discover my insurance had been cancelled and I was fired for not calling into work by 7:00am. At this time, with few other options, I thought I would take some time off and try to get over whatever was wrong with me. It has always worked in the past. Unfortunately no matter what I did (vitamins, exercise, stretching, walking, working out) nothing worked. I kept getting worse. I am STILL getting worse!                 About 2 months ago, when I finally faced that I could not work anymore and had run out of savings, I hit rock bottom and had no choice but to file for Indigent care. For the first time in my life I asked for help. I just wanted to see a doctor so I could get better and go back to work. When I filed for Indigent care, I was told I had to file for Social Security Insurance and Social Security Disability Insurance. I was informed that the Cardon Outreach Disability Advocates would be contacting me to file for SSI and SSDI for me. I filed with Indigent care and SSI and SSDI and have been waiting for over two months for approval.                 Last week Cardon left me a message that they need more information from me and will call me next week. Mind you, 2 months have passed and they still have not filed yet. Indigent care stated that they cannot help in till I’m approved for SSI and SSI needs a doctor’s diagnosis for approval. I was then told this would take several months to over a year to get approval.                 No doctor will see me now without insurance or approval from SSI or SSDI. Emergency rooms will only stabilize me, tell me that I should really go to my doctor, and then show me the door after charging me over $7,000 for doing essentially nothing. That obviously does not help. Now all I can do is waiting for approval and pray, as I run out of food and water and the lights blink off overhead.                I. Am. Starving. I am physically dying from starvation in the most prosperous nation the world has ever known. I grew desperate enough that I swallowed my pride, scraped together what little gas I had, and went to the Alabaster Food Bank in Baytown TX. I was turned away at the door because I could not show any proof of income.                 I informed them that I have not worked in over 10 months and that I have been living on my savings due to sickness and that has run out. The lady was very insulting and confrontational, and stated ""EVERYONE has income"" and had me escorted to the door, which she then locked behind me.                 I was never rude or mean. The only thing that bothered me was that the only other individual there for help was driving a $40,000 Cadillac SUV, wearing gold and diamonds and playing on her new iPhone.  She received help because she had proof of income. She has a job and just wanted to save money on food. I have no job, no money and no food so I did not qualify.                Everyone who knows me knows that I started working full time at the age of 15. I have worked two or three jobs at the same time for most of my life. I have spent my life helping people, family and friends but mostly strangers that needed help and could not help themselves. If I could, I always did. I never expected nor accepted anything in return. I always told people to pay it forward (because I love that movie) and help someone that can’t help themselves. That is my favorite hobby, next to rescuing dogs.                 So here I am, doing the hardest thing I have had to do in my life. I’ve swallowed all my pride and I humbly ask for your help. I’m used to helping people, not people helping me. But now I’m asking for your help. I need to get to a doctor now and at least get my heart stabilized or I’m afraid I will actually, physically die waiting for SSI or SSDI to kick in.                 Please, there are so many areas I need help with. Prevent the collapse of my trailer, the only home I have, that I need to live and recover. High Doctor Bills, of which there are many. Emergency repairs to my trailer Emergency repairs to me car. Propane to heat water and cook. Back rent, future rent. FOOD! Physical food! Resupply and help me make it in till I get approval for assistance. Most important is get to a doctor! I know the tests are expensive but I have no choice if I want to live!  I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart who took the time to read this and for any help or prayers you can provide. God bless.",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/yczxb4#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/yczxb4#,,,

As many of you know, Jamie and Alex were very excited to learn that they were expecting.  They were over the moon when they saw that little blue line!   At baby’s 20 week anatomy ultrasound, Papa Joe was entrusted with the long awaited gender, which he would later share with the rest of the family through a Facebook live gender reveal. Baby BOY was given the name Raymond-Joseph “RJ” after his 2 grandfathers.During this ultrasound, the doctor’s initially diagnosed baby RJ with Achondroplasia (dwarfism) due to short bowed bones seen on the ultrasound.  Little RJ was closely monitored by a high risk specialist and was later diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease.  Alex and Jamie only shared this news with their immediate family as they did not want to scare anyone with such an uncertain and frequently changing diagnosis. As the pregnancy progressed they saw additional bone abnormalities and fractures on RJ's femurs, arms and ribs.  This made the diagnosis more certain. On April 9th at 11:36am, sweet little RJ made his grand entrance into the world.  He was a fighter from the beginning, breathing on his own, despite his tiny lungs and multiple rib fractures.  He spent the day in his mommy's arms, surrounded by so much love and kisses.  RJ earned his angel wings and joined his Grandma Diana and Uncle Lii later that day at 6:55pm.  He was comfortable, loved and surrounded by family who loved him so much.  As Jamie and Alex move through this extremely difficult time of what they expected to be such a happy and joyous celebration of new life, there are so many of us wondering, ""what can we possibly do to help?""  Food, gifts, hugs, support? ...there has to be something we can do.  After some discussion, it was determined that something that would be a huge help to them, was a fundraiser for medical bills, funeral expenses and memorial funds.  Although it feels like we all wish we could do so much more for this family, I hope you will all join me in contributing something to help them with this unexpected cost at such a difficult time in their lives.  We send them prayers, warm thoughts and all of our support.",,,https://www.gofundme.com/littleRJ#,,,

He's had hundreds of breaks in his lifetime and uses an electric wheelchair to get around. He is only 2' 11"" inches tall and has severe scoliosis and limited reach and muscle strength due to the OI.    In spite of all of that, Jerome is active in the community and very well loved. He is married with three step children, works a full time job, has a part time job and is a foster parent.  Jerome needs your help to remain independent! Jerome's van is adapted with special controls that allows him the independence and freedom that only having your own vehicle can provide. There is no public transportation near Jerome's neighborhood. Today, Jerome has over 250,000+ miles on his 16 (going on 17) year old van. Things are wearing down. The body is starting to rust through. The transmission is going. The fuel pump has been replaced three times. The van is in the shop almost monthly now.  Without a vehicle of his own, Jerome cannot get to work, he cannot provide transportation for his stepchildren or his foster children to school, friends’ houses or appointments. He can't do simple things like running to the grocery store or stopping to surprise his wife with flowers.  We are only asking for your help to raise the funds for the adaptations (listed below) required to allow Jerome to remain independent. The adaptations are approximately $81,000!!! Again, that does NOT include the price of a new (used) vehicle.

My nephew Isaiah has been through a lot in his 13 years - over 70 broken bones and 12 surgeries – in his fight against osteogenesis imperfecta (“Brittle Bones Disease”). OI is a rare genetic mutation that affects his body’s collagen, resulting in fragile bones, but also affecting his joints and ligaments and even his organs. Despite being in pain every day, “Zay” is a fighter, and has a great attitude. Doctors said he’d never walk, but he did – and he even ran! His courage in the face of lots of adversity inspires me. The Fight of His Life With Lots at StakeNow, he’s in the biggest fight of his life. His condition has led to a form of scoliosis that is rapidly progressing. In the last 4 months his spinal curve has progressed from 30° to 60°+.  Much more and it can affect his breathing and heart. He’s had to withdraw from school due to the pain. Typically this would call for a spine fusion surgery, which carries with it a high % of complications, many of which are negatively life-changing. In Isaiah’s case, if he has spine fusion surgery now, he will almost certainly have to have another one after he finishes growing. All of this means that he will lose mobility and his pain will increase, and during his life the scoliosis may continue to progress and necessitate even more surgeries still. Ultimately, if he goes down that road, Isaiah may become wheelchair bound instead of being the active kid he is. And he was also just diagnosed with dilation of the arterial root – a potentially life-threatening heart condition - so a 6 to 8 hour surgery is just not what he needs right now if he can avoid it. There is a lot at stake.There’s Hope: A Non-surgical Treatment that Works!But my brother Lon and his wife Amanda have found a treatment for their son, and I want to help Isaiah get it. They’ve discovered a leading-edge treatment called the Schroth method and a high-tech brace called a SpineCor that have achieved tremendous results at treating the underlying causes of scoliosis (rather than just surgically patching up its affects), and even reversing the curve, even in kids with OI. It’s cutting edge, but it’s also the most studied and proven successful non-surgical method in the medical field and has been in use for decades in Europe, despite the fact that some in the orthopedic field seem oblivious to it in the US. And it works. The closest provider is Scoliosis Systems in Dallas, and Isaiah will travel there next week where Isaiah will undergo intensive training in how to self-align his own spine on a daily, even minute-by-minute basis, as well as perform certain exercises each day, all the while wearing a high-tech SpineCor brace 22 hrs a day that is engineered to rotate his spine back to its ccorrect position (or as closely as possible). Win-Win SituationEven if this treatment just slows down his scoliosis until he’s finished puberty, a spine fusion will be much more successful at that time. And this method and the brace (which can be worn comfortably and discreetly under his clothes) will help Isaiah throughout his lifetime maintain his spinal position and thus reduce the risk of re-surgery, increased back pain, and loss of mobility. That would be a huge win for Isaiah’s life, and I believe he’s the kind of person that is worth investing in. Cures are CostlyBut as with many medical advances, the financial costs are high, and my brother’s insurance will not cover it. Their years as missionaries didn’t make them rich, either. It is going to cost $4000 for the brace and $2,000 for the intensive 3-day training, plus doctor’s visits, x-rays and a litany of other tests that come to another $2500 (details below). There’s also the costs of travel and lodging and they have to purchase special exercise equipment for their home. This is all going to cost them around $9,000+ initially, and with quarterly follow-ups their out-of-pocket expenses will likely exceed $12,000, for the year. They’re willing to sell all they have to get Isaiah this critical brace and treatment.  Urgent Appointment Next WeekWould you help them help their son? Due to the rapid progression of Isaiah’s scoliosis, they have booked the earliest appointment possible, March 31-April 2, which is just a week away, so yes, they could use it immediately.  If you miss this week, they could still use the help at any time, as their expenses will continue to add up over the year. Thanks for your awesome generosity.  Lon and Amanda and me will be forever grateful to you for standing with Isaiah in his battle against this awful disorder.  Stay posted, because I will post updates as Isaiah battles scoliosis with his awesome new tools and techniques  and continues to show us all what real courage looks like!

A classification system of different types of OI is commonly used to help describe how severely a person with OI is affected. For example, a person may have just a few or as many as several hundred fractures in a lifetime.PrevalenceWhile the number of people affected with OI in the United States is unknown, the best estimate suggests a minimum of 20,000 and possibly as many as 50,000.DiagnosisOI is caused by genetic defects that affect the body’s ability to make strong bones. In dominant (classical) OI, a person has too little type I collagen or a poor quality of type I collagen due to a mutation in one of the type I collagen genes. Collagen is the major protein of the body’s connective tissue. It is part of the framework that bones are formed around. In recessive OI, mutations in other genes interfere with collagen production. The result in all cases is fragile bones that break easily.Jarrett Steele was born on March 24, 2005 with this rare disease called osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).  He is as aware of the world around him as you and I. He feels his bones shatter the same as you and I would, only more often. Throughout his childhood Jarrett has traveled to Vanderbilt Children's Hospital to have metal rods wedged into his delicate legs. The collective pain Jarrett will endure in his life will make any of our toils seem insignificant. But the space between the hurt is filled with smiles. As you meet or see Jarrett, he never stops smiling. We hope to only improve Jarrett's quality of life with this device and help educate the world about his disease. He is my little cousin and I was hoping to surprise him with a walker for his therapy. His family has been requesting this device since he was around four years old and has never been granted it through insurance. He has never been able to walk. He needs this device to help support himself and give him the chance to finally get out of his wheelchair. He has a very rare problem and he is one amazing boy.

As most people know expenses add up quick and now she needs support.  Jess and Nate are young, strong parents that need a little help to get on their feet with expenses. I understand that the holidays have just passed and money is a little tight right now but Jess needs our help more than anything right now. Jess and Nate need time to mourn while keeping their head above water with bills. All I ask is to spare a couple of dollars if you can to just help out a little. Every little bit counts in times like these. I know this not only means a lot to me, but I know Jess and Nate will also be extremely thankful and grateful for any little help.Please keep this family in your prayers. I know there are a lot of parents out there that could not even imagine what they are going through at the moment. Please keep baby Blake, Jess, and their family in your thoughts and prayers.Thank You,Crystal Hamilton",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/q45sscy4#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/q45sscy4#,,,

Over the course of my life I've broken my femurs about 41 times. I've had multiple surgeries which left me with an impressive amount of metal in my legs. I now use a wheelchair full time and crutches to move from my chair to the couch, desk chair at work, bed or car. As a result of OI, and all that goes with it, arthritis is also an issue. It also can result in very tight, sore, achy and downright painful muscles, joints and ligaments. This isn't just in my legs it's all over my body.Having a slow healing fracture (it's been a non union fracture for almost 7 years) in my femur, very stiff muscles, joints that ache, using my arms & upper body for the majority of my mobility and ligaments that allow joints to slip/move in ways they shouldn't, soaking in a hot bath is not only mentally relaxing it's physically beneficial in so many ways. After being in a wheelchair all day, or in my desk chair at work, overusing my arms, upper body, stretching and pulling on already sore muscles, many days I just want to take a long, hot bath to ease some of the aches & pains. You cannot get the same effect in a shower. When I was not using a wheelchair full time and could walk unassisted it wasn't an issue getting in/out of a bathtub. That was also when we lived in another house with a different bath tub. That bathtub wasn't ideal but with a small 'step stool inside the tub' I could transfer from the edge of the tub to the stool then take the stool out and I was good to go. Now we live in a different house (which in itself is a huge blessing from Jesus) that is about 90% or more accessible to me. There are a few modifications we made before we moved in and still have a few to make. However, our master bath is alltogether a different story because it has a huge garden tub. Sounds pleasant right? Perhaps for average people who can sit/stand/walk with no health issues, or minimal ones, it'd be an amazing DEEP garden tub. For me....it's a reminder everyday that I can't take a long, hot bath to soothe my breaks, aching muscles and joints. Thankfully I have a sturdy shower stool that enables me to safely take a shower by myself with absolutely no risk at all. I can't use a 'lift' because it could cause significant damage to my bones just by my weight against the straps.  many risk factors with a lift that I'm not willing to put my life in jeopardy for it. Also, walk in tubs are not handicap accessible for wheelchair users (at least not for me). Standing on a wet/slick surface to 'walk' out of the tub.....no thank you, that's not going to happen. One slip and I could break more bones that I care to count. My husband also couldn't stand in front of me to support me to walk in/out because of the size of the opening and position of the seat. It's taken me months (ok years) to be able to do this. The kind of tub that would be the most safe and accessible for me is the Aquassure ADL Slide in bathtub. More about the tubs can be seen here  http://www.aquassure.com/our-products/adl-slidein-bath/. Thank you so much for being a blessing and sharing my story with family & friends!

I started this gofundme page to help raise money for a new vehicle for my brother Jon, who has osteogenesis imperfecta, a brittle bones disease. Jon is an artist who is 36 years old and has been blessed with unbelievable skills of water paintings, pendants, stain glass and blowing glass. He has suffered through many broken bones and countless number of surgeries that has led him to a hopeless point of where it is becoming too expensive to pay for the help that he needs as well as the things that will help him in his every day life. His vehicle is becoming too unsafe to drive because all of the necessary handicap equipment is broken. The only way he can get his wheelchair out is to lift it out of the side door because the ramp is no longer working along with other equipment. Because of how brittle his bones are, it is dangerous for him to exceed his strength compacity. The cost to replace his handicap equipped van is $40,000 - $50,000. Please consider donating for this good cause! He is an amazing and caring man that is the same as you and I but with a unlucky and devastating story that he lives with everyday, but still manages to keep his head up.

On February 10th 2011 she was born with osteogenesis imperfecta Type 3/4 and thus began her journey. By the time she had reached 10 months of age, Juliette had begun pulling up to stand and it became clear she would need rodding of her legs in the near future.     Her first rodding surgery was in March 2012 followed by the second leg at the age of 15 months in May 2012. Unfortunately, only rush rods were available which do not extend with the bone as she grows. By July 2013, she had outgrown them and replacments were needed.  All this became possible through the care received at Shriners Hospital in Los Angeles to whom we are eternally grateful.   Now at the age of five, she has had twenty two known fractures mostly in her lower extremities as well as four rodding surgeries. Despite the physical setbacks, Juliette has always been determined to get right back up and keep on going. It is through her strength and the benefits of rodding that walking became possible. This is where your help comes in as I explain the following information.    Juliette currently has what is known as ""rush rods"" but would benefit the greatest from Fassier Duval Intramedullary Rods also known as ""telescoping rods"". This is a type of rod that extends with the long bone as the child grows thus reducing the frequency of surgeries needed. Since Juliette is an independent walker, these rods would be the best choice for her. Our local Shriners Hospital does not offer telescopic rods so we have decided on traveling to Shriners Hospital in Chicago on May 16th to see Dr. Smith.      While our local Al Malaikah Shrine Temple has been so generous in helping us with the airfare to and from Chicago, other expenses will be on us. This includes transportation, food, and the possibility of having to change our airline tickets in case we have to come back sooner/later. I am currently not employed and although my mother will be helping us, our income has been greatly depleted due to recent hardships.     I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read her story. Any little bit helps us reach our goal and please feel free to share this as much as possible.",Updates   4,https://www.gofundme.com/juliettemarie#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/juliettemarie#,,,

To date, she has had well over 50 fractures and 7 surgeries that consisted of rodding and re-rodding different bones. She is going to be getting surgery within the next few weeks to get her tibias rodded. Her family has dealt with this since Kendra was 2 weeks old, after being brought to the hospital with leg pain. It turned out, she had a broken femur, and while conducting x-rays, had the other femur broken as well. The same day, they were putting an IV in and broke her arm. These types of fractures are what characterize OI. Those with this type of disease can fracture with little or no trauma to their bones. They are shorter in stature and have trouble with mobility, but easily the strongest group of people you will ever know. Kendra has never let this disease get her down. She is always smiling and loves life, even though she is ""not like everyone else"".  Kendra got a wheel chair 7 years ago and has used it on a regular basis ever since then. She does walk, but cannot walk long distances and is not currently walking at all due to the bowing in her tibias. We are praying for a quick recovery after surgery and more comfort for Kendra. With her chair being 7 years old it is falling apart. The seatbelt is too small (she got this chair when she was 2), the foot rest is too short, the brake on the right side of the wheel is broken to the point that it will not engage the brake, and the left handle broke off recently.Kendra's family has been in contact with the wheelchair clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children in Washington DC, however her REM (Rare Expensive Case Management), will not cover a new wheelchair. The expenses will have to be paid out of pocket. Because of the surgery and returning to school, Kendra is in need of a new wheelchair. Getting a new wheelchair would ensure that Kendra could attend school comfortably, without the embarrassment of having a wheelchair that is literally falling apart. Kendra's mother is a single mom and has never asked for any help. She works extremely hard to ensure that Kendra is well taken care. This often means spending countless days and hours at Children's Hospital in DC, which comes with its own expenses. If there is anyone with the means to be able to help with this cause it would be so greatly appreciated by the family.",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/yv228rus#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/yv228rus#,,,

My name is Patrick. I'm setting this GoFundMe up for my mother. She doesn't know i'm doing it, and i hope to keep it that way until i can actually provide something tangible for her because she isn't one to willingly accept stuff. 


My mom, Kimberly, is 43 years old. When she was born she was diagnosed with osteogenesis Imperfecta - aka Brittle Bone Disease.  Growing up, the doctors said she should expect to be in a wheelchair before she's 18. My mom is an andrenaline junkie, and though she is very limited, she loves to have fun. She refused to accept confinement to a wheelchair, and has spent her life avoiding that fate. No just avoiding it though, but still living life as full as she could. She used to love Go-kart racing, going to the shooting range (we are from Texas), playing paintball, riding ATV's (slowly, of course), and more. There have been a load of hiccups along the way. More broken bones than i can even fathom counting. She usually breaks a few bones a year. Every time though, she heals, and she gets back out there. I left home 6 years ago. Since then, i've come home once or twice or year when i can, and i see my mom moving just a little slower, or her back is a little more hunched. It's obvious that her disease is finally catching up to her. Last week i was home on vacation and i was heartbroken to see how fragile my mom has become. It's to the point that even walking is becoming taxing to her after 20 minutes or so. A few years ago she had a compression fracture in her spine. She has deteriorated to the point that the only way for it to heal is total bedrest for months. Sadly, this wasn't possible. She had bills to pay couldn't afford to take off from work for such a long period of time. So, she kept at it. Now she's up to 7 compression fractures in her spine and it is taking a serious toll on her mobility. She's embarresed to go out with her friends because she looks like a hobbled old lady. She isn't physically able to do many of the things she used to love doing anymore. She does her best to stay positive, but it's obvious that a wheelchair is in her near future, and it's something she fears, i feel.


 


While i was home, a friend brought over his Playstation VR. I knew my mom would be interested in it, so i asked him to load up a gun range simulator for her. My friend explained how it worked, and she put the headset on. It was like watching a kid at Chuck E. Cheese's. She was hooting, and hollering. Ducking and weaving. She was so into it. To watch her temporarily be removed from her disease, and get to partake in hobbies that she hasn't been able to enjoy in years was the single happiest moment for me while i was home. I've talked to her numerous times since then, and all she wants to talk about is the VR. How fun it was. How she want's to try and get one. What types of games she thinks she would enjoy playing. I can't currently afford to buy this for her, and i know for a fact that she can't afford to purchase it for herself. So, here i am. I don't feel this will actually amount to much, but if i can get at least half the cost of this covered i think i could probably afford to buy it for her for Christmas. 


I guess if you have any other questions about my mother, or her bone disease send me a private message. Thank you for reading this. ",,,https://www.gofundme.com/kims-vr#,,,

Shortly after birth x-rays were taken and discovered 2 fractures. Doctors explained that Kylie-Ann has a rare genetic disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), aka Brittle Bone Disease. Basically there is a defect in the collagen that makes her bones weak and break easily (since it is genetic, simply giving her milk/calcium will not help). Breaks can happen at any time and without reason, just hitting her arm or leg slightly can cause a fracture. So far Kylie-Ann has had 10 fractures and is only 3 1/2 months old. She is currently on a medication called zoledronic acid that helps put calcium in the bones to make them stronger. At the moment she gets an infusion of this monthly and will later be every 3 to 6 months. This is not a cure, but it is said to help reduce the amount of fractures she will have in the future.  There are many different types of OI and more are being discovered as time goes on. As of now doctors are unsure what type she has. What we do know is she has bowing in her legs and arms, she will most likely be of short stature, scoliosis is a possibility, and we are unsure if she will ever be able to walk. There is possibly surgery in her future that can hopefully help her walk, but this is a ways down the road.  Kylie-Ann is seen by many specialists and has doctors appointments ranging from every week to at least once a month and more if she has a fracture. She has physical therapy and occupational therapy that switch off every other week to help with muscle strength since weak muscles is also a part of her disorder. There are many things that can help make life easier for Kylie-Ann such as splinting materials to have at home to treat her fractures immediately (a box of 10 splints is roughly $200, not to mention ace wraps, gauze, and medication) as well as equipment for physical therapy and eventually a wheelchair. Unfortunately insurance only covers so much making it hard to give Kylie-Ann everything she deserves. We are opening this fund to cover Kylie-Ann's medical costs, travel expenses for appointments, and home modifications for now and the future.   At only 3 1/2 months old she is stronger than anyone I know and manages to be a happy baby with a smile on her face even with the fractures and pain she has to go through.

To most kids this would be a bump on the head and nothing more, but not Lali. Lali has Osteogensis imperfecta Type III aka (Brittle Bone Disease) which makes normal bumps and bruises way more tramatic. In this instance, a simple fall resulted in many skull fractures, spinal fractures, and bleeding on the Brain. Doctors had to perform emergency surgery to relieve pressure from her head and install plates to help fix her skull bone. Lali made it through surgery and will be in a neck brace for several weeks. As you can imagine, the expenses that accomodate a hospital stay can weigh heavily on a family. And with all this going on, her parents are unable to work much which limits their income. At this point there is no release date from the hosptital, but they did say she would be released from the PCCU (pediatric critical care unit) and put in a normal room sometime soon. She is doing very well and getting better by the day, which we pray will result in quick recovery.We are putting together this campaign to assist them with their expenses during this trying time.

He will be traveling to Samoa in May for the internship.The students, along with their instructors, have the opportunity of implementing and refining an education program to share with children and their caregivers. The program draws attention to the seriousness of a sore throat and outlines the appropriate actions to be taken. A team of echocardiograph technicians, led by a board certified cardiologist, complete the program by offering free echo screenings for the children. The involvement with and oversight of the rheumatic program by indigenous nurses, doctors and governmental health agencies has been, and will continue to be, essential to the overall success of the program.Now that you know what we are raising the money for, let me explain why this is so important for Lehi and our family. Lehi and I are the youngest of 5 children. Lehi has suffered from osteogenesis imperfecta - or brittle bone disease since birth.Being fraternal twins, doctors noticed Lehi was smaller leading up to delivery. There was even talk of possible dwarfism.Shortly after birth, Lehi suffered a broken femur during normal care and doctors knew something was wrong. He was transferred from Childress to Amarillo and diagnosed with brittle bone disease, which affects about 30,000 Americans. Even though it's a genetic disorder, there is no family history.Lehi returned home for two weeks, then contracted pneumonia and went back to Amarillo, where he remained on a breathing machine for 42 days. Doctors determined Lehi couldn't breathe on his own, and placed him in hospice care with no breathing machine.But Lehi refused to die.Eventually, he returned to Childress, where he had to be tube-fed and continually connected to an oxygen machine. During a checkup a month later, it was discovered that the breathing machine had never worked. Lehi had been breathing on his own.Lehi never complains about having endured approximately 70 broken bones and more than 20 surgeries. He's always been known for his upbeat personality despite a life constantly filled with challenges few could imagine.Lehi was confined to a wheelchair at age 5. He has steel rods in both legs and one arm to prevent his longer bones from breaking. Within the near future, he will have to have surgery on both legs to straighten out the bowing that has occured.Going to Samoa has always been a dream of our family. Our father was born and raised in Western Samoa. He later moved to Hawaii where he attended BYU-Hawaii and worked at the Polynesian Cultural Center. He met my mother there and they were later married in the Laie, Hawaii LDS Temple.Our father was killed in our own home when Lehi and I were 6 years old. My mother was left to raise 5 children, ages 13 to 6, on her own. Money was always scarce growing up. My mother worked hard to support and take care of us, but there just wasn't enough to go around. Although we never had much financially, we were blessed to be raised in a loving home.We have many times over the years thought about going to Samoa as a family, but have never been able to raise enough money. When Lehi was selected for this internship, we decided as a family that we would do whatever it takes to get him there. If anyone ever deserved something like this, it's Lehi. I know that Lehi will be able to inspire these children with his special spirit. Having an opportunity to serve in an area that is so close to our family history is a once in a lifetime opportunity.There are so many worthy causes out there to donate to. I hope you can see how much this would mean to Lehi and our family. He's an incredible person who I truly believe could make a lasting impact on the children of Samoa. Any donation will mean to world to Lehi. Spread the word and let's get Lehi to Samoa!Fa'afetai!NephiHere are the details of Lehi's internship:Students see the islands of Samoa in a way that creates an appreciation for the culture of Samoa while making a difference in the lives of the people. Participants will have the opportunity to earn internship and department credits. Students will be immersed in the community by teaching elementary children in the local schools about strep throat and rheumatic fever. Participants will have an opportunity to interact with healthcare workers and experience clinicals in local hospitals and clinics.The islands of Samoa include beautiful beaches, tropical rain forests, and other natural wonders. Students have an opportunity to balance work with fun, and experience authentic Samoan culture.

Curtis is only 43 with a family of four. Looking at him, you would think he is in perfect health. Curtis has always eaten well, been active and maintained a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately heart disease is a strong genetic trait that many of the Koepenick's share. His heart attack came as a huge shock to all of us.Curtis is an independent contractor and was working on a job site when he had the heart attack. He made it home and went to urgent care where he was rushed by ambulance to the hospital for emergency surgery. Curtis is back in the hospital today after further complications.Curtis has NEVER been one to ask for help, that is why Robin and I have decided to start a Go Fund Me account. With hospital bills mounting, already in 6 digits, monthly medications costing over $1000 and being self employed in a very hands on and strenuous job as a contractor, Curtis will not be able to fully provide for his family of 4 and the medical attention he needs.Curtis has been married to his loving wife Nicole for over 16 years. They have been together as a couple since high school. Curtis and Nicole have two boys, Cobie, 14 and Tanner, 11. Some of you are aware that both Nicole and Cobie have osteogenesis, also known as Brittle Bone Disease. Because of this genetic disease Nicole has been unable to work for many years. She has many health challenges herself but you would never know, she is such a trooper. We are asking all of our family and friends to donate towards the Go Fund Me account to benefit Curtis and his family. The donations will go to Curtis's medication, medical care and their monthly living expenses until Curtis is well enough to be back at work full time. Unfortunately Curtis has been unable to relax and lower his stress during this critical time because he is so concerned about income.Please help us in reaching our goal.  Let's put Curtis's heart at ease so that he can fully recover and get back to the work that he loves. We would love for you to share this with all of our extended family and friends.Robin and I want to thank you for all of your love and support. We want to make sure our big brother is here with us and his family for at least another 40 years.

It is a Brittle Bone Condition that makes her bones break EXTREMELY easy. This condition also effects other areas of her body such as her lungs. There is no Treatment or cure. There is 4 types of OI. She has type 3 which is on the severve side.Trinity was born at 32 weeks. From the moment she came into this world she's always been a fighter. She was born with 8 broken bones, and that was Via C - Section. In total she has had over 65 Fractures of her bones in her lifetime.  She will always have the risk of more everyday for the rest of her life.Trinity is completly wheelchair dependant. She cannot walk or weight bear at all. She will most likely Never walk.  Along with her brittle bone condition she has developed Severve Scoloiosis. It is one of the worst cases any of her doctors have ever seen. She has 2 curves in her spine. Her spine is in the shape of an S . We recently went to get a pluminary function test to access her breathing as we know that the scolosis will affect her lung space.  Her tests showed she only is breathing 45 % of what the normal person should be. The doctor also found that her left lung no longer functions as the scolisis has compressed the lung so much it can not expand at all. Last august at her Orthopedic appointment the x rays showed the left lung was compressed but working. So in less than a years time , it went from compressed and functioning to Non Functioning at all. She is completly dependant on her right lung only.This will never get any better, Her condition will only get worse. There is no time frame on how quick things will happpen. It just depends on how she grows and how much the spine curves as she grows. Spine surgery is NOT a option , as the risk of her Not surving the surgery is very great and her spine could collaspe due to the weight of hardware used. She could also end up with brain damage and or Paralysis from her shoulders down and or her waist down. So we made the decision the 3 of us and her orthopedic surgeron that surgery is just not an option due to the risks and how much her quality of life would change. This was extremely difficult to take in , Knowing if we do nothing the scolosis will get worse and could take her life, But doing the surgery could have horrible outcomes. The worst feeling as a parent is felling Helpless, Helpless that you can't take your childs pain away, or fix them. Watching them hurt is awful and knowing you can't help it, is worse.Our goal is to give Trinity the Best Life Possible with the Time we are given. We strive everyday as parents to do so. Trinity is an amazing kid. She is Kind, Funny and will brighten anyone's day. I am a Better person because I am her mother. She is my Best Friend.  I cannot imagine my life without her. I will do everything in my power to make sure she knows how much she is Loved and appreciated everyday.We are raising Money to GET TRINITY TO Lambeau Fields, In Green Bay , Wisconsin. Trinity Loves the Green Bay Packers and Absolutely Loves their Quarter Back Mr. Aaron Rodgers. I have Contacted the Green Bay Packers Organization myself asking for help before creating this page. They do everything thru Make A Wish. Trinity had a Make A Wish when she was 4 years old and is Not Eligible for another wish as their policy is 1 Wish per Child per Lifetime. We will use the money to pay for gas, hotel expenses, and to rent a Handicap Accessable Van just like ours to get her there. Flying is not an option due to the severity of her lungs. We need to rent a Van like ours that is handicap accessible. This is not cheap at all to do. Our reasoning for not using our van is because it is the only vehicle we own and we must keep it in good condition as long as possible to get Trinity wherever she needs to go. Any left over money would be used Soley for her entertainment purposes while in Green Bay, Musuems , Packers Pro Shop, Etc. Thank you for taking the time to allow me to share our story.  Doing this for her would mean the world to her Dad and I . We can't take her pain away , But we can atleast Make Her Dream Come True.                                                     Thank You,                                     Jennifer, Nick and Trinity",Updates   6,https://www.gofundme.com/2a3aqyt5#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/2a3aqyt5#,,,

My name is Anna and I am 5 years old. This week I will be celebrating my kindergarten graduation and I am very excited. I work very hard in school, earning all A's, and I have had so much fun learning how to read and do math this year. Unfortunately, my family is having a hard time paying my school bill, and we could really use your help.  Let me tell you a little bit about myself. Two and a half years ago my Mommy and Daddy came all the way to Russia to adopt me! They knew I was incredibly special from the moment they saw my picture and worked very hard to save enough money to bring me home. One of the things that makes me extra special, other than how cute I am, is that I have Brittle Bone Disease (called osteogenesis imperfecta).  My bones break very easily, and I have to be extra careful to protect them. I have to get an special IV medicine every three months call Pamidronate to help my bones to heal and not hurt so bad on a daily basis.   My bones even have a hard time growing straight because my muscles are stronger and pull them in crazy directions! That means that since I've been home, I've had 5 surgeries to put rods into my bones, and that every week I have to go to physical therapy, occupational therapy, and aqua therapy.  I worked very hard with all my doctors and even learned how to use a wheelchair so I wouldn't have to be pushed around in a stroller anymore!Even though I was doing very well, my Mommy thought I could do better. So even though she made very yummy cupcakes, she decided to close her bakery in order to spend more time with me! I miss the cupcakes, but I sure love spending time with my Mommy. Now we go to the therapy pool every day and I practice walking in the water. Our church also bought us a brand new walker for me to practice using! In just 5 short months, I've gotten so much stronger! I'm now able to use my walker to check the mail each day and even for short trips to the grocery store!   Unfortunately though, my Mommy has been really worried about money. My Daddy is in the Army and we are SO blessed that all my medical bills have always been covered, but we've fallen behind on paying for my school. We need help with 3 months worth of tuition and the deposit to ensure that I will have a place in first grade next year! I love my school, it is a very small private school and my teacher loves me very much. She even helps me walk each day and gives me extra help with the things I physically have trouble with.

She gets around by scooting on the floor or riding in her wheelchair. Due to her constant pain, physical limitations, and the lack of a family car, she doesn't get to do as many things as most young women her age, and can't hold a permenant job.The highlight of her year is working as an actress at the local haunted house in Ashtabula Ohio. Part of the fun is going to the annual Haunt Convention in Columbus Ohio. She travels with a group of fellow Haunters and stays in a hotel, attending the event and having a blast. It is one of her favorite things to do, along with going to Comic-Con events. However these events are expensive and she and her family do not have the extra funds to pay for them. We are hoping to raise enough money for her to go to both events as well as take another little trip or two to see more of the sights of the midwest. Tiffany was recently featured in TLC's Two In A Million. It's a new TV series about people with rare genetic disordors who get the chance to meet and make friends with another person with the some condition. If enough money is raised we will also send her on a trip to visit her new friend Destiny who she meet through the show! Let's give Tiffany a great gift of having some wonderful experiences this summer! Thank you so much!",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/26uewwk#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/26uewwk#,,,

Christella was a wonderful little girl, and very bright. For everyone who meet her she became their angel. She suffered from a very rare condition called osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, where her bones would break very easily due to lack of collagen. Hers was an extreme case and caused her whole body to be weak and crippled. The days leading up Nov 15 she had what appeared to be a normal cold. No one could imagine that it would end the way that it did. Wednesday morning her mother found her unable to breathe. No one could do CPR because of the OI; chest compressions would crush her. The family caretaker called 911 and they rushed her to Children's Medical Center where she was pronounced dead. The family is devastated and on top of that there is a large funeral bill that they have no way of paying. $9000 is due by next Wednesday the Nov. 29.

A firecracker of a redhead with with loads of personality. Ryker is 3 years old and was born with a rare disease called osteogenesis imperfecta. Also known as Brittle Bone Disease. This bone disease affects the collagen in your genetic makeup, so no amout of milk/calcium will fix it.  Ryker also has a  rare severe recessive form of O.I. listed as Type 8. There are only 5 recorded type 8s in the USA. He was born with over 18 counted for in uterine fractures. During birth his neck and left tiba were fractured. Since then Ryker has broken over 40 bones, resulting in many physical set backs and progressive bowing.  Ryker can't sit up, roll over, walk, crawl or stand. O.i. has also affected his muscles, severely. He just gained head control around 18 months and could hold his own bottle around 19 months. Ryker receives 5 therapies a week ($20 each)  to build endurance, strength and work on speech.  We travel anywhere from 45-100 miles a day for these appointments. Every 8 weeks, for 2 days Ryker receives an IV infusions of a bisphosphonate called Pamidronate. Bisphosphonates help strengthen the bone and reduce bone pain. These infusions make an 8 hour day at the hospital each. In December of 2013 Ryker had FD rods placed in his femurs at Childrens Hospital of Omaha Nebraska. We travel 15hrs one way there for a yearly clinic of OI specialists and all surgeries. Before Ryker's femurs would break from practicing to sit. He never raised his legs because his bones couldn't hold them. Two months after bilateral femoral rodding, Ryker was touching his toes! Since September 2013, Ryker has fractured his humeri at least 20 times or every 2 weeks. They fracture from picking up his paci. Touching his face. Reaching for a toy. It doesn't take much.  September 10th 2014 we traveled back to Omaha, Ne for our yearly O.I. clinic and on September 16th 2014, Ryker had his left humerus and left tibia rodded. On December 1st, 2014 we traveled back to Omaha again for 6 days to have his right humerus and right tibia rodded. As awesome as insurance is (haha we all know), there are many things they don't pay for. In flights and a rental car for 6 days we are looking at $2000. Fortunately we stay at the Carolyn Scott Rainbow House, which works off donations. It's  asked that each family donates at least $15 a night of stay. Thats another $100 for the trip. There is always food, gas and parking. Which is around another  $250 for the week. All in all, each one of these surgeries cost us anywhere from $2500 to $3500 out of pocket just in travel expences alone.  Insurance declined pretty much every piece of equipment ordered. Claiming  they are ""convenience"" items. When did a potty chair for a 3 year old become a convenience item?  We With all this being said,  Ryker is still just like any 3 year old. Crazy and strong willed. This may be a long road he travels but he will never travel it alone.

(by Lucas' Mom, Paula)  Lucas is a twelve-year-old seventh grader with a life-long love for music, and a big talent for and devotion to drumming!  What started in babyhood as an activity to strengthen Lucas' arms and range and motion has become his musical joy!  Lucas was born with the genetic condition osteogenesis imperfecta, or Brittle Bone Disease, which means that his bones are very fragile. He has had hundreds of fractures, even before he was born, and has suffered numerous serious health problems because of his disease. He has faced them all with the strength his bones don't have, however, and has shown the world his courage with a loving smile on his face!Lucas started his musical journey (which really began with a love for music at birth!) with Kindermusik, a complement to the therapy he received at home to, strengthen him, continuing until he started school. He then participated in elementary programs and musical plays at his school. Reaching middle school, Lucas was met with his first obstacle in the person of his award-winning 6th-grade band teacher. Lucas had been assigned numerous non-integral instruments and wasn't learning much, while his parents thought he was fully participating in the band. After solely using an iPad, he finally laid hands on an actual instrument, a snare drum, toward the end of the year, but by then it was too late. The teacher, feeling that Lucas' ""skills weren't sufficient to continue"" in her band (and help her win awards, we suspect) kicked him out in a cold administrative meeting with Lucas' parents. If only the teacher had done what a teacher should do, devote time to helping a student learn, then she would have seen that Lucas was and is SUPER-TALENTED, something that his past Kindermusik and present music teachers already knew!  The minute he started drums with his present teacher (performing an advanced skill in his first lesson!), he proclaimed, ""I have joy in my heart again""!!This is where you come in :) All Lucas wants to do is have the chance to play music, especially drums. For his lessons, he plays on a generously borrowed set at his teachers' studio, but he would like to have the opportunity to practice at home from the support and security of his wheelchair, and that requires a specially measured and built drum set.

The day she was born the DRs said that she would live only five days. From that moment on her fight for life began. She was born with osteogenesis imperfecta, OI a brittle bone condition. ON May 24 2000 Jen and I became a team to make sure that Madison would live her short life to the fullest no matter how difficult or how many sacrifices or tears we would shed. Madison became our everything. Madison was going to live life to the fullest extent. Many doctors offered there expertise and services and we gratefully accepted them. Sometimes we determined that some operations were just too risky. Especially with neck and spine surgeries. We did not want to waste any of her precious time. Living in a life state of pain and going through continuous surgeries and years of recoveries and then more surgical revisits. Because we new that her little body could not tolerate that. God had a special plan for her. Jen and I tried our best to have Madison live a normal as physically possible life. We didn't want her to be home schooled. So we became Madison's advocate and after many meetings with school administrators we became her chaperone. Jen went with her every day to help her until we could get her an aid to protect her from getting run over by the other children. Madison thrived she became a straight A student. And went to VES , VMS and VHS all the same school that I had gone to. She became a bit of a celebrity with her classmates and teachers because of her unbreakable spirit and that her Dad was a working Actor. As Madison got older and wiser she began to understand what the DRs were saying about her body and condition. Her biggest fear was becoming paralyzed and losing control over her bowels and suffering embarrassment in front of her peers. I would talk with her for hours and try to reassure her that this would never happen even though the DRs said it was inevitable and she was destined to be that way if we did not operate on her neck to straighten it out. After careful consideration we determined that it was just to risky. We decided to get her a neck braces and back braces to help out with the curves. And it worked as good as possible. Madison touch so may people and became a hero not only to Jen and I but everyone she met. When I booked The Curious case of Benjamin Button she taught me how to use a wheelchair and was my inspiration to play Benjamin Button and the role was nominated for an Oscar. When the AMAPS invited me to be a guest speaker I gave her credit for my accomplishment. When madison turned 6 she asked Santa Claus of a little sister. Jen and I were afraid to try to have another child just because of the possibly of OI. We asked Madison geneticist what the odds were of that happening again. And it was a million to one. The next year Ava was born healthy. Madison and Ava were the best sisters you could ever have. Now Ava is our everything. In her short time on earth she accomplished many things she was and actor an artist a writer an avid reader and hero. She has traveled to Paris, Venice Italy, Rome, The Vatican, Freeport Grand Bahamas, Los Angeles, NJ, NYC, Miami, Atlanta, New Orleans, North Carolina, Washington DC, Marryland, Delaware, Corder lane Idaho, Spokane Wa, Seattle Wa, Orlando Florida, Venice Florida, Disney world and Disney Land and Harry Potter world. Madison got go to a Red Carpet Premiere of Pirates of the Caribbean At world End, where she on national television. Madison also lived in the same house that I grew up in.She has inspired me and everyone that has crossed her path to make the best our of their lives no matter how difficult it may be. God had surely made her a Angel now. GOD BLESS YOU MADISON WE LOVE FORVERThe funds are for a Funeral and Church services also a Casket and Burial plot under a beautiful Oak tree.

Thank you so much for clicking our link and taking a look at our page. As many know, Kai is such a sweet and silly little boy that already has had trials he's had to overcome. Thankfully, our boy is strong and has faced any challege with the joy of the Lord being his strength. His sweet smile proves it.Just a little back story: Malakai was born with a genetic disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta, or OI (Many know it as brittle bones disease). Ever since we found out he would born with this at 21 weeks pregnant, we have prayed and pleaded over our son. God listened and we were blessed with a healthy baby boy. So far, OI has not been a trial. About 5ish months ago, Kai fell and broke his leg, but thankfully, it was a common break among toddlers, let alone and toddler born with OI. We give that up to the Lord as him being a normal toddler that landed wrong on his leg. His bones where bright white and strong in the xrays, and his leg healed perfectly in 4 short weeks. Our main concern right now is his teeth. OI not only effects the bones in his body, but it effects a few other areas, his teeth being one. Kai's 4 top teeth came in at once when he was aroung 6 months old. So, we bought training toothpaste and a thomas the train tooth brush just like any normal parent. Within a year of that, more teeth came in, as usual, but the top four slowly began to disapear. He never took a bottle, nursed until he was almost two, but I was determined to brush his teeth and wipe his gums to prevent cavities: he ate his first piece of cake at his first birthday party, and his drinks are mainly whole milk and water. We brush his teeth twice: even three times a day depending on what he eats. we are diligent, but nothing is seeming to help. He grinds his teeth and they would just chip away. They were so soft that the two eye teeth have now chipped completely into his gums, and his middle two teeth have started to follow suit. They are becoming inflammed in his gums causing sensitivity and exposing the middle layer of his front tooth.Long story short, we need your help. We have seen a few specialists and are confident that we have found a soultion for his teeth and a team of doctors that are amazing: and willing to help. Ultimately means surgery. They would put him to sleep and remove the inflammed teeth and if possible, crown his front two teeth to prevent further infection and any damage to his adult teeth. They may not be able to save the front two teeth and may need to remove those as well. My heart hurts at the thought of that. His smile is so beautiful and lights up anyones day but his health is our first concern.  In order to have the surgery, which is not covered by our insurance, we have to pay in full before we schedule the surgery: which is around $4200 for the entire procedure including anesthesia and the actual crowns. It would not be a matter of concern if they would allow monthly payments, which we are more than willing to do, but they require full payment before they would even schedule the procedure. It is time sensitive if we are wanting to save those front teeth and prevent any further infection. This is all we could think of in the time frame we are needing. It's incredibly hard to have a huge need as this, and we come to you with a humbled heart and gratitude. If you are unable to give, please just keep us in mind of prayer and maybe share this page. Thank you so much for reading!

Those of you that know Mark also know that he does NOT like to ask for help, but these events have put a significant burden on him, both emotionally and financially because he has been unable to obtain health insurance because of his medical conditions. As a result of these injuries, Mark will not be able to get our or acquire any sort of work for 8-12 weeks. This is an extremely tough situation for us both, but we are very confident that God will bring us through it much stronger than we've ever been. We would absolutely appreciate ALL prayers, positive thoughts, or financial assistance to help with medical bills and other expenses until Mark is able to get back to what he loves doing (inspiring others). Both of us truly appreciate the love prayers and help that each one of you continue to offer.

Osteogensis imperfecta is congenital bone disorder characterized by brittle bones that are prone to fractures and breaks. People with OI are born with defective connective tissue, or without the ability to make it, usually because of a deficiency of type I collagen. Samuel limbs were too flexible, and his head seemed a little large for the rest of his body. At birth, Samuel suffered over 100 fractures. Since then, he has broken 15 large bones, and has had countless, broken ribs, legs and broken arms. Samuel has had all of his long bones in his arms and legs rodded with metal rods to prevent fractures. In 2013 Samuel's metal rods was removed out of his left arm because they came out through his bones almost puncturing through the skin. Now Samuel is suffering from scoliosis, which is causing severe pain in his lower back and causes shortness of breath. Samuel is currently a 9th grade student at Spring Grove Area High. In addition, Samuel is an Honor Roll Student, formally a chorus member and has been nominated by his school counselor to the Link Crew to indoctrinate incoming freshman this upcoming 2015/2016 school year. Despite the obstacles of being a teenager with OI, Samuel has a very positive outlook on life and prefers to focus on the things he can do, instead of the things he can not. His attitude towards life has blossomed into quite an impressive slate of accomplishments.Also Samuel enjoys attending church where he sings on the choir and participates in youth groups. Like kids of the 21st century, he is a gamer and he loves social media. Samuel has gotten quite heavy over the years and difficult to care for without the use of medical equipment at home.  Samuel's father is Disable American Veteran that suffers with severe lower back pain caused by herniated discs and spinal stenosis.  Sadly, last year Samuel's mother was diagnose with bulging discs in her back from lifting him. Therefore, we are requesting financial assistance for necessary medical equipment such as stair lift, wheel chair ramp and vehicle lift for his wheel chair. This is not a scam to get money, Samuel is really in need of help with his medical equipments.Thanks in advance,The Mckoy- Johnson Family",Updates   3,https://www.gofundme.com/Samuelmckoyjohnson#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/Samuelmckoyjohnson#,,,

My Name is John and this is our daughter Faythann. Both Faythann and I have osteogenesis imperfecta  or OI (brittle bone disease). First, we want to say that we are very blessed to have the life we do. Despite our physical challenges we live life and that there are others that have OI and suffer far greater than we do.  Now, the reason why we are asking for your help. In 2015 while on a trip to NY to visit one of her best friends and attend a  music festival in Central Park to see Ed Sheeran, Faythann’s wheelchair hit a bump in the street and ￼she was thrown out of her wheelchair to the ground below. She instantly knew she broke both legs. The first call was for an ambulance and then to my wife Brenda and I. If you have children you know how we took the news. Faythann was taken to a new small hospital in the city. Faythann was the first patient with OI to be brought to their ER department. Although treating people with broken bones is very common that is not always the case for those of us with OI. There are issues with internal bleeding, breathing concerns due to decreased lung capacity caused by OI and many other considerations. Faythann has had many surgeries placing stainless steel rods in her legs in hope of preventing fractures not to mention major back surgery.  Brenda and I opted to wait at home to see just how bad it was and what the Doctors at the hospital along with Faythann’s specialist here wanted to do. Not an easy task by any means. We were so blessed that her best friend did not leave her side for even a minute. After getting Faythann to the ER and getting her immobilized and getting her pain somewhat under control. The Doctors there felt it best that she was transported back to RI to be treated by her team of specialist that knew her best and had more experience treating OI. We agreed!! Now the problem was how to get her home safely without causing more trauma. Our two options were a 4-hour ride by ambulance or 40-minute med-flight to local airport then 15 minute ride to Hasbro Children’s Hospital. The ambulance ride would have required heavy sedation and could cause more trauma for sure. Our bones can fracture with very little force. Also like I stated above breathing issues were definitely concern. Medication used for pain control does effect one's breathing  The med-flight was recommended by both doctors and even though we knew there was a chance that our Health Insurance my not cover it, this was the best option for Faythann’s safety. What would you have done? Just to add one smaller obstacle, this was the weekend the Pope was visiting NY and the Air Space was in lock down until the next day.  The next day Faythann was flown home (best friend by her side) and then taken to Hasbro Children’s where they performed surgery and placed her in what is called a spica body cast. Two days later she was home confined to a hospital bed. She was in a lot of pain but she was home. Where we are now. Faythann has fully recovered and will be graduating Rhode Island Collage this summer at the top of her class. Her major is communication. Don’t be surprised if you see her on TV someday with her own show. Faythann is one of the most amazing people you will ever meet. I know you’re thinking (you’re her Dad, of course you feel that way) If you know her, you know I speak the truth and if you don’t, I challenge you to prove otherwise.  She has taken on the financial responsibility of college and prides herself of standing on her own two feet. No pun intended.  After two years of fighting with BlueCross and Medicare the total bill of $54,000 is Faythann's responsibility.  As her parents we would pay this in a heartbeat if it were possible. The company Air Methods has been very patient and understands our situation but still needs to get paid something. They have offered to settle the bill for 12,000.00 if paid by February 22nd. We are hoping that you can help us take this financial burden away from Faythann and relieve her worries. This is very hard for us to do. Asking for help like this. I have always tried to be totally self-sufficient despite my physical challenges and have tried to teach Faythann the same.  Sometimes in life, We all need a little help. – Thank you",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/bd6xe-medical-expense#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/bd6xe-medical-expense#,,,

She never stops repeating, ""Remember to make today a beautiful memory for tomorrow.""  This picture of Kelli is just that a memory, as her illness has made her look like a caricature of herself. Kelli has vEhlers-Danlos Syndrom, osteogenesis Imperctia and Tarlov cysts on her back so numerous that her doctor was unable to count them. It is the Tarlov cysts that have caused her to be unable to sit up or walk. Kelli is bedbound , her condition prevents her from being able to sit up beyond 90 degrees, or walk at all, she is unable to push a manual wheelchair. Kelli is trapped in a 20 x20 room. She sometimes says that she feels like she is in prison and is unaware of her crime.  What we need is an electric chair ( Like the Invacare® TDX®SP, TDX SR Power Tilt, Recline, & Leg Lift Power Wheelchair that reclines, raises and lowers) and if possable a van with a power lift to give her some mobility. Kelli is an amazing woman with a strong will and a kind heart for anyone she meets. Kelli wanted to be on Broadway her entire life, but due to her many illness she was  able  too, that however did not keep her from living life to it's fullest, except for the last 4years. Kelli spent 2 of those in an active state of dying from the TIC line infections from the high doses of pain medication  that her hospice ordered,  we left that Hospice  in the summer of 2013 and the new hospice is helping her to live again but  she has been bed bound for 2 years and will never walk again.  Kelli is in Hospice  for pain relief  and end stage vEDS/OI but should live many more years.   Kelli has had nothing short of a miracle. She is alert, coherent and articulate (she was the opposite of all this less than  17 months ago) so much so that she is wondering why she is a prisoner in her own room. Vitas is doing such an amazing job that Kelli is ""Living"" not dying and not even close to it. God has Blessed us with a miracle but that miracle is bitter sweet if Kelli is unable to move about freely. Now that her pain is controled it is torture to watch her trapped in that bed day after day.  Kelli never complains but she dreams and hopes of seeing the Sun Rise, Christmas Lights, Shopping and Starbucks.
All we have is a manual reclining wheel chair (that is very uncomfortable for her) she will can tolerate it for no more than an hour or two, at Christmas Kelli said that she felt like a piece of furniture since she had to ask someone to move her when she wanted to move or go to someone. An electric wheelchair would at least give her some independence and mobility so that she could go outside and enjoy the weather or watch me (her mother) cook, bake or roll along on short walks with me. If we are able to raise enough money we would also like buy van with a lift so that she can go shopping , to the beach to watch the sun rise (her favorite thing) go to church or get a ""Hot"" fast food hamburger or Starbucks for the first time in 3 years.

He has osteogenesis imperfecta better known as brittle bones disease and has had about 100 broken bones in his life time. A ...lot of his fractures required major surgery. For information on O.I. visit  www.oif.orgHe should have graduated a year earlier but due to many fractures he missed more than half the school year.  O.I. is a hereditary genetic bone disease which make the bones week and fragile. It is a genetic disorder where his body does not produce collagen, therefore his bones are not solid. The are more like Swiss cheese which make his bones weak. Michael was diagnosed with O.I. when he was 6 mos. old and had his first break (his femur) while in his mothers arms. His family was very lucky that the Orthopedic on call diagnosed with O.I. him while he was in the emergency room. Detectives were called looking for child abuse. Unfortunately, many children are taken from there parents due to the this disease being so rare.Since then Michael has had countless fractures. We stop counting after 60 plus. It got to the point we just could not keep count. Between 6mos. and 4yrs. he'd have a break 5-6 times a year, sometime more than one bone at once. Thanks to a new drug at the time, between 4yrs. and 8yrs. they slowed to 1 or 2 a year. They told us the drug would not work for him anymore and took him off that drug and put him on another. They put him on Fosimax because they thought it was very similar to the Pamidronate he had been on. By 11 he was back breaking between 5-6 times a year but now almost always more than one bone. Basically, he turned into what would be considered fine china. At one time he broke 5 different bones with one fall resulting in 4 open compound fractures including his femur. That happened when he was 14 and he has not walked since.  Through it all he has never let it get him down. He is always smiling and friendly, I know I can say I've ever heard him speak badly about anything or anybody. He just accepts whatever comes and embraces it. He was very well liked and respected in school by his teachers and his peers.  My neighbors are angels for taking the time an effort neighbors for doing this this Michael . We have not told Michael anything about this yet. Our hope is that they raise enough to get him a van. He graduated with honors and his tuition for school is not a huge issue thanks to grants and the Hope Scholarship. We just don't have the means to transport him there and give him the independence he has so deserved to get to the school that he wishes to attend. If not we will use whatever monies are donated in his behalf to remodel the bath room or to make our home more handicap accessible to give him as few obstacles to make his life as easy on him as possible. Blessings to our dear friends and neighbor who has felt it in their hearts to help Michael and Blessings to all who have taken the time to read this. Thank you for any donation you may feel you would like to give.For more information on O.I. visit  www.oif.org ""” with Michael Barry.",Updates   3,https://www.gofundme.com/4u05b4#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/4u05b4#,,,

My name is Jaylyn Maddox, Im 16 years old, currently a student in school and approximately 3 weeks ago I became a mother to a beautiful precious baby boy by the name of Bryson Cordell Maddox.  At the beginning of my pregnancy I became very ill and was told at my first sonogram that my baby was diagnosed with Skeletal Dysplagia (a rare form of skeletal defiencies). I was then set up with specialist at Presbytarian Hospital in Dallas, TX whom after reviewing the prognosis of my baby, gave me a decision to terminate the pregnancy or prepare for the battle up ahead. I chose LIFE over DEATH! I began home schooling with the help of my family sacrificing and rearranging their life. It has been a long, stressful, complicated pregnancy but with my faith and my family I was able to endure what some would say is impossible for a 16 yr old. All the traveling, severeal doctor appointments, emotional drawbacks, health and mental issues, mom/dad/siblings/family missing work to be supportive all came with a price. Love of course was the highest price but staying financially able to keep up with everything has also been a heavy trial on us. My mother and father have sacrificed beyond trying to continue to work, take care of my younger siblings, be there emotionally/physically/mentally for me and support Bryson through this all. Im forever grateful for this.At birth Bryson was diagnosed with one the most critical forms of Skeletal Dysplagia which is known as Osteogenisis Imperfacta also know as ""Brittle Bone Disease"". Genectics doctors are testing to see exactly what type (1-4) he has to better treat him. He was born with multiple fractures which occured during utero and after birth and was immediately flown out to Childrens Hospital where he yet remains in critical NICU. At this time we have a special team of doctors working with Bryson and keeping him comfortable with pain management of morphine and Tylenol due to the  fractures he has in both arms, legs, collor bones and even ribs. The fractures in the ribs are what causes the pain and respiratory distress. He is recieving forceful respiratory treatments with the hopes of being weaned as he grows and his little lungs become stronger. When and if studying this disease of Osteogenis Imperfacta the progressive condition needs life-long management to prevent more deformity, complications and even death due to respiratory complications.With that being said, empathy is not what we are searching for, but prayers and monetary gifts will be so appreciated and much needed. I know God is in control of my baby boys health but I also want to be able to lighten the burden on my family financially for traveling, lodging, meals and work shifts that FMLA will no longer cover financially for my parents . Any and everything is appreciated and I, Jaylyn Maddox, will never take any of it for granted. Im grateful and thankful for the support, prayers and thoughts of everyone! God bless you all from the Gross Family, I and Baby Bryson! WE BELIEVE GOD!",Updates   14,https://www.gofundme.com/9j8bdo#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/9j8bdo#,,,

Her disability is called osteogenesis imperfecta, which means her bones can break with little or no cause. She was raised by her mother who also has an disability called Cerebral Palsy. Jessica was made very aware early in her childhood that their is no such thing as 'can't' and was always motivated and determined to get things done. She had the opportunity to work at Southampton Fresh Air Home, her childhood summer camp, and enjoyed being behind the scene of a place she still calls home. This opportunity opened many doors including a job at United Cerebral Palsy, working with children with various disabilities. As well as a job at Bellevue Hospital NICU. Jessica got into art at a very young age and used it as an outlet for coping and teaching. Art has always been a true drive in her life, using many different mediums to express herself without any barriers. She has also sold some of her artworks at different venues. She got into rowing four years ago. Because of her disability she is limited to non-contact sports, but still wanted to enjoy a sport nonetheless. She found a program that adapted rowing and was hooked from then on. ""On the water I am free, I am a athlete!"" Jessica says. She has since participated in many races including C.R.A.S.H B's World Indoor Rowing Championship in Boston and came in at second place on March 1, 2015 in her heat. This summer Jessica also competed and came in 2nd place at the BAYADA Regatta in Philadelphia, PA on August 15, 2015.Jessica started dancing three years ago with Kitty Lunn. When she discovered her program through a friend, it was such a thrilling experience for her. To know not only could she do choreography, but she could do wheelchair ballet and put on performances to show the world people with disabilities can do this too! Jessica now also dances with Zazel, the founder of ZCO Dance Project, a dance company for people with disabilities. Whenever given an opportunity, Jessica loves participating in adaptive events. She recently went scuba diving, water skiing and surfing. All made possible thanks to Wheeling Forward.Jessica's most recent achievement was on September 12, 2015 when she participated in the Ms. Wheelchair New York competition in Albany, NY and won the Ms. Wheelchair New York 2016 title. As Ms. Wheelchair New York 2016 Jessica wants to raise awareness about equally including students with disabilities in the school system.  Jessica has witnessed many children today unintentionally being left out of field trips and social time with their peers. ""This creates stigma, and promotes the idea that disability means inability"" says Jessica. ""I will travel to schools and help parents, teachers and school officials to communicate with each other more efficiently and help them develop a plan when planning school trips and activities so that all children are included equally. I will create workshops that will discuss my chart of communication, promote advocacy and express the importance of implementing a Disability Rights week in their schools"".""My goal as MWNY is to bring light to children with disabilities and their place in the classroom, as well as raise awareness that if this type of exclusion continues we well have a huge decline in students becoming active members of the community as well as achieving a higher education due to the lack of social acceptance. Children are our future and each one deserves a chance to be successful community leaders just as their peers."" says Jessica about her goals as MWNY 2016.",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/7r4tmh28#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/7r4tmh28#,,,

And this happened each year for 8 years, from age 4 to age 12.  One year, the doctor did not realize that she had the wrong rods until My Angie was already on the operating table, under anesthesia, and cut open.  She closed her up and went and told My Angie's parents about the mistake and rescheduled the surgery.     Although My Angie had a small group of friends in high school, boys failed to see her for the enchanting beauty that she is until college.  Unfortunately, most of her life, when people have looked at My Angie, they only see a wheelchair and not a loving heart, a soaring spirit, and the beautiful body that is IN that wheelchair.  And then one day...     I was going to a convenience store with friends and, as I was walking in the door, there was a lovely young lady sitting in a wheelchair next to the door.  I said, ""Hello."", and she replied, ""Hi."".  When I came out of the store, the girl that had been next to the door was now sitting by the pay phone with another girl.  I got in the car and waited for my friends.  While I waited, I could not stop looking at the ravenous beauty in the wheelchair.  ""That gorgeous creature actually said 'Hi' when I said 'Hello' !"", I thought.  ""She wasn't snobby or told me to take a hike.  She said, 'Hi'.  Wow!"".  I couldn't stop staring.  When my friends got in the car, we left.  Over the next couple months, I saw her many times.  I would actually follow her for blocks trying to get up the courage to say something to her.  When that failed, I started asking around town if anyone knew her and I fianlly struck gold.  I had a friend that knew her.  For the next couple weeks, I was glued to him.  I kept asking him to call her and get her over to his house.  Then one day, I was doing repairs to his wheelchair and a knock came to the door.  ""Come in."", he called, and in rolled the object of my affection and another of her friends.  ""This is your chance."" I told myself, and stood and walked over to her with outstretched hand.  ""Hi, I'm Adam."", I said.  ""I'm Angie."", was the reply.  And our journey began.  That was back in January of 1995.     My Angie has stood by me, consolled me, stuck up for me, hugged me when I needed it, fought for and beside me, and been my friend, girlfriend, confidant, soulmate, ally, wife, ""partner in crime"" as they say, lover,date,co-pilot (in the car), mother, and ""boss"" all wrapped up in one.  Are we married?  I say, no, we're much more than that.  But for all she has done for me, I'm coming up short on being able to do for her.     Due to her OI and the fact that she is getting weaker, My Angie has been needing to rely on her power wheelchair much more lately.  And it will only happen more and more.  We have a 2001 Ford Taurus right now, but that power chair ain't gettin' in any car!  What we really need is a wheelchair accessable minivan.  The ramp on the side would allow her to roll right up into and out of the van and the tie downs will keep her safe in transit.  And most importantly, the van will allow her to hold onto some independence so that she can ""push herself"" anytime that we go anywhere away from the house.  We may have met 20 years ago, but we still LOVE to hold hands (yes, we still do that) as we walk, and that means a great deal to her.     My Angie means so much more than the world to me that I can't express.  Anytime there is a problem in front of her, I try to fix it.  But this one I can't fix.  The van cost is $30,000 due to the conversions needed for the accessability and we simply have NO MEANS to get that kind of money.  We don't need a ""new"" van, just new to us.  Like I said, the Taurus will never be able to transport a power wheelchair.  If we go somewhere, we must take the manual wheelchair, but I have to push her because she gets tired quickly.  When we are near the apartment, we use the power chair and I walk so we can hold hands.     If you wonderful people would find us deserving of any of your hard earned money, we would put it towards the purchase of a used wheelchair accessable minivan to be used anytime My Angie needs or wants to go anywhere; the store, the doctor, etc.  The funds would also go to the title transfer and any taxes and fees incurred from the purchase of the minivan.  Any extra funds would be used towards taking My Angie somewhere she has always dreamed of going; the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Georgia.  She loves dolphins and whales.  In fact, we spent our honeymoon at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland, and this would be even better.     Can you help a love story keeps it's independence?  Any donations are heartily and gratefully apreciated.  If you have any questions about osteogenesis imperfecta, they can be answered at  www.oif.org .

I'm Bill, Rebecca’s husband. And I would like to introduce her to you.Rebecca was born with osteogenesis imperfecta, better known as brittle bone disease. There are several stages of the disease where some people can walk and only break bones easier with the likelihood of 50% - 75% of most people. Then there is the stage where they break all by themselves. Rebecca is very near the last stage. Rebecca experienced several bone breaks while still in the womb. By age 5, Rebecca had over 500 bone breaks. The doctors declared much earlier that Rebecca would never survive to be 5, but God had different ideas. Rebecca has had over 2,000 breaks before 25 and they simply quit counting.Both arms and both legs have broken several times, and they failed to grow back together. Her left arm did grow back together, but it has a 90 degree bend just below the elbow. So she has only one usable limb, the left arm, and it is limited. Bent bones are a part of the stage of OI she has. She was born in 1968 and they didn’t know much at all about the disease then. Today, they can do a lot during the growing years and make life much better, but never near normal.Rebecca has severe scoliosis and her internal organs are all squished out of place. Rebecca’s right lung is almost totally shriveled up and doesn’t do a lot of good. Because it doesn’t move a lot of air, it is very susceptible to pneumonia which she has been hospitalized for several times.Due to a combination of the scoliosis and brittle bones, Rebecca can’t lay flat on anything without a lot of small pillows supporting her. The same goes for laying on her side. Nearly all of her ribs have been broken many times, mostly from coughing and sneezing. Rebecca has severe allergies too. The allergies are caused by heightened nerve endings all over her body including her taste buds and nose as well as the bones and muscles. Rebecca can’t even lay on a wrinkle because it causes her bones to bruise and eventually break. I have jokingly called her the “Princess and the pea”. It all comes with the osteogenesis imperfecta.Rebecca is 3 feet long and weighs about 50 lbs. I say long because Rebecca can't stand up ever and can’t sit up for more than an hour or two. Rebecca does everything in her chair, toileting, bathing, and most of the time, sleeping. We have a regular bed and I used to be able to pick her up out of her chair and put her into bed and visa versa. But in the last 11 years, both of my knees have given out and I have other back problems. I can still lift her, but the chance of one of my knees buckleing causing me to drop her or even slightly stumbling, is way too high and could even break her back, so I can no longer do that safely. Earlier in her life she wiggled out of her chair into it the bed in the evening and back into the chair in the morning. We jokingly call it the ""butt walk"". Sometimes Rebecca gets to sleep like a real person. But lately, she has been suffering a lot more pain than she has in the past and can’t do that very often.Rebecca and I met about 12 years ago through a match making service. I lived in Arkansas and she lived in Missouri. Rebecca was about 32 and I was 58, weighed 270 lbs, and 6’2”. Can we say odd couple? Our getting together is a real Cinderella tale, but that’s another story for later.Over the past 11 years, my health has declined considerably. I am no longer able to lift and hold Rebecca like we used to.Rebecca gets cabin fever a lot because of her bones staying sore to one degree or another and of course the allergies. So even a trip to the grocery store is an adventure to her.About 3 years ago we bought a wrecked fixer upper handicap van for $1,895 plus shipping and I started to restore it. We simply couldn’t afford a better van. We had to replace the right front and the right sliding door, and a lot of other stuff to make it usable for Rebecca. It was the first time ever that Rebecca rode in her chair on the passenger side. She always had to ride in the back before. I continued to work on it as much as I could, but it is now obvious that my restoration plans won’t make it. I had estimated it would cost about $8,000-$9,000 over a period of time if I did most of the labor. But now the computer in the van is giving a lot of trouble and it will cost a lot more money than it is worth. As it sits now, we can’t get as much for it as we have already spent on it. It stops right in the middle of traffic and jerks so bad it hurts her bones, and a new computer costs $999 from the dealer.Rebecca can’t drive so she must be driven if she needs to go to the grocery store, clothes shopping, movies, etc. Rebecca many times has to see doctors and she is prone to Pneumonia and most ambulances can't handle her without breaking bones. At least I don’t trust them that far.The old van has straps on the floor to secure her chair in so it doesn’t jostle her delicate frame. That puts a limitation on it because it is now difficult for me to get down to strap her in. We need a van that has a floor lock (EZ-Lock) that she can drive her electric wheel chair on and it automatically locks. Then she can push a button and it unlocks. You can imagine what kind of independence this one little thing can give her. Then anybody could take her anywhere without having to be trained to secure her in properly.So she needs another van and it doesn't have to be new. New conversion vans go as high as $50,000 to $60,000. I found a 2006 handicap van for less than $30,000.00. These vans are very expensive because the floor is cut out and lowered 10 inches to give head room and maneuverability for the chair. It also requires an automatic door opener with an automatic folding ramp. The conversion on to a new van is $15,000 to $20,000 dollars depending on what is needed, so I consider under $30,000 for a used 2006 van a blessing. It must also have a very gentle ride for her delicate bones.Rebecca is a very brave women and very cheerful even through all of this as you can see from her picture.Would you consider helping Rebecca to get a newer van? No contribution is too small. They all count. If you can't, would you share this page on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, or any other social network you may be using? Her bones and healthcare providers would greatly appreciate it. Especially me.Thank you.PS.

The disease has no cure and no known treatment. To learn more you can go to WWW.OIF.ORG Basically it causes my bones to break very easily and makes doing a lot of things difficult. Things you take for granted on a daily basis, are things I have to struggle through just to finish them halfway. I usually suffer completely broken through fractures in my femurs or hairline pelvic breaks. I am only 4'3""and have a curvature of the spine that makes it tiring to walk long distances.  And by long I mean, from the parking lot to the store, or around the store itself. I've dealt with well over 50 broken bones in my lifetime, and had  4 major surgeries resulting in metal rods being installed inside my femurs for strength.  I have never really let this get in the way of me having a regular life. I get asked all the time about what it’s like being so short or what living with a disability is like and the response is, I have never known different. There are definitely some drawbacks to getting older and the disease becoming more pronounced due to Osteoporosis. I try very hard not to let it get me down or to wallow in self-pity. I try to live my life to the fullest and be excited for all the things I can do, not be labeled by all the things I cannot do.I have levers installed in my vehicle so I can drive with my arms since my legs are usually my weakest link. Not only can I not reach the brake and gas pedal and still see over the steering wheel, but the pressure from using a brake pedal could cause stress fractures in my legs. Some of the simplest of things can cause me to break bones.   I was recently rear ended at a stoplight by a man going 50mph which shoved me into the two cars in front of me. This caused a 4 car pile up.  Not only did this total my car, it also broke my Pelvis and my Scapula (shoulder blade). The combination of the Handgears, Seatbelt, and Airbag hitting me all at the same time caused a usually stable bone to snap.So lucky to be alive, but my life is put on hold. My poor Blue Bell, Totaled and DestroyedI was completely bedridden for the first 6 weeks. It is definitely a lesson in humility to have to slow down what you are used to being able to do for yourself and have others do for you. I use my wheelchair daily, although I am able to walk and move about for small distances and within my home. When I am injured I rely on my wheels heavily. Even under my best circumstances I need some assistance getting from point A to point B.Laugh through the tough times, My sister-in-law takes me to many of my Dr appts.  I own a standard wheelchair that I have had since high school. Good Old Arm muscles normally get me where I need to be, but since this accident I can’t even manage that. I can’t push myself in my wheelchair because I need two good arms to go in a straight line. Not only is this uber frustrating it is also very limiting. I need someone’s help just to get from my house to the driveway. From the car to the doctor's office. I am having complications with my Scapula fracture and most likely will need major surgery involving plates and screws and other metal bits to hold it all in place and with that news I realized my arm is going to be out of commission for quite a while. I will not be able to use the wheelchair by myself for weeks if not months. The older I get the longer the fractures take to heal and the worse the recovery and rehab are. This is only the second time I have injured my shoulder region and I am very concerned that it will affect my range of motion permanently, making pushing myself not only harder than ever before but extremely painful. That being said a Scooter would be a lifesaver. It would give me the mobility and independence that I need to live my life to the fullest at the touch of a button. Being able to keep up with my friends and family.Only problem is that my insurance won’t cover the cost of such a life changing device and I cannot afford the cost of one out of pocket. I work full-time at a major retail store and don't receive disability or any other assistance from the government. I have been out of work since the accident, so about two months so far and with this major surgery looming over head I see a long recovery time ahead of me, meaning months, or even more of being out of work.  I have many hobbies and interests, but among those are that I love costumes and dressing up. Two of my favorite past times are going to local renaissance fairs and Anime/Comic Conventions in amazing costumes I have put together. I like that I can express myself like this despite my disability. I feel like it makes a tiny difference if a disabled child, or any other person for that matter, sees me embracing my differences and celebrating them and doing what makes me happy. Maybe the world will stop looking at disabled individuals as people who cannot do for themselves, and more like people who do things differently. Without the aid of a scooter I believe I won’t be able to continue doing many things that I love to do, but more importantly the things I have to do on a daily basis. With the use of a Mobility Scooter I would be able to do things on my own again, injuries or none. It would improve my way of life and help me to continue being a contributing member of society.Hanging with my Niece and Nephew on HalloweenJokes on You...HandicapableCobblestone you will not defeat me My version of a superhero.Friends help you through thick and thinI want to Thank You from the bottom of my heart for looking at my donation page.

People are always telling her, “I know normal bodied people that do not do half of what you do in life!” Cheryl is truly an inspiration to all who know her. However, to maintain her independent and active lifestyle, she now is up against a challenge that she cannot meet alone.Due to years of Ohio winter weather conditions, the chain and motor to the lift on her current 2006 van are completely rusted and can no longer be repaired. Without a van, she is unable to work, run daily errands, and preserve her overall independence. Cheryl now needs a new accessible wheelchair van. As you can imagine, such vehicles are very expensive.

He is very well-liked by anyone and everyone he comes in contact with. He has the greatest personality, he's one of the sweetest and kindest little boy I know! He is funny and a very smart little boy at that! Noah has what is knows as OI. osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a disease that causes weak bones that break easily. It is known as brittle bone disease. Sometimes the bones break for no known reason. OI can also cause many other problems such as weak muscles, brittle teeth, and hearing loss. About 20,000 to 50,000 people in the United States have OI. I'm hoping they are able to come back home to some type of normalcy, and not be taunted with the day to day stresses that come along with this disease and what it takes to have Noah cared for on a day to day basis. With that being said... We will be putting together a benefit for him and his family to help with medical bills, travel and lodging expenses. As parents, we will do whatever we have to do for our children, but we all know it takes a village! As of right now, we are awaiting their safe and successful return after surgery. We do not have the location, time or date set in stone at this time. However, I cannot do this on my own. If you would like to contribute in any way possible, and help this family out, We would be forever grateful! I will say this.. Nobody likes to ask for help, but when it comes to giving your kids what they need for a comfortable and successful life.. We as parents will go the extra measure in efforts to make it work.

With this condition comes chronic asthma as well as possible hearing loss so you can imagine the number of hospital visits, stays and doctors appts. It’s inevitable though and we STAY prepared should something happen to him. Princeton knows he has this condition but he doesn’t let it stop him from being the fun, loving little boy he is. He gets discouraged at times watching other kids play and jump around but I assure him that his brains will take him further than he can ever imagine! Lately, life has thrown us some curve balls. I had to quit my job in July due to child care issues and not having stable child care. From there I was unable to keep up with my car payments and lost my car as well. So now we can’t make it to any of his doctors appointments or if he has an emergency fracture. We are currently living with my sister and cannot afford our own place. Having stability for him is THEE MOST IMPORTANT thing to me. For the longest, I couldn’t figure out what to do as far as working as Prince is 100% dependent on me. I couldn’t just look for ANY job and if I did I had to go around someone else’s schedule to make sure he was good and I could get to work. Having a special needs child is definitely a challenge but it’s well worth it because he looks at me like I’m SuperMom!

We have traveled to China to adopt our son. We need to raise our remaining adoption expenses immediatly. Due to a grant from Brittany's Hope the first $2,500 donated will be matched.  Your donation will be doubled!!!Peter was abandoned in a park in China at approximately 3 years old. Both of Peter's legs were broken in many places and he was unable to walk. Peter has osteogenesis imperfecta, commonly known as brittle bones.  OI is a lifelong condition with no cure. Over time and through a very painful process, it cripples the body. He will endure great pain, countless doctor visits, and many surgeries. Peter is a ""special focus child,"" meaning a child very hard to find a family willing to adopt him. He will require a lifetime of specialized care. We are fortunate that we are prepared for Peter's care as our oldest son, Wade, also has OI. This adoption will change all our lives but it will have an immeasurable impact on our boys. Wade and Peter will have a brother to play with during the many hospital visits, surgical recoveries, and countless hours in doctor's offices. An IV buddy during the 6 hour Rx infusions. A friend who understands when your legs are just too tired to go on. A peer who can hold your hand when there are no words to express the suffering. Wade is ready to be a big brother. As he says, ""I will teach Peter to feel good about himself; even when people stare at you in your wheelchair."" Peter will be loved beyond measure, receive the best medical care in the country, have a quality education, and know the protection of a God centered family. More than what we can give Peter, we feel blessed that we get to be part of his life journey. God has a plan for our boys and we stand in awe every day.Peter's adoption will cost $35K and we have already personally paid $15K. This expense is great but saving a life is worth every penny. With Brittany's Hope matching grant your donations will be doubled. We can also provide a tax-deductible receipt for donations if you desire.We cannot help every orphan but we can help Peter.

This is his story. He was born five weeks early and it quickly became apparent that he had come too soon as he began to have problems breathing.  He’s a fighter though and for the next 28 days he fought everyday to breath, grow, mature and prove to everyone in the NICU that this little Pheonyx was going to rise!  We finally got to bring him home on 9/11/2015 and were so excited to face the challenge of this special little gift from God.  You see before Pheonyx was born, my doctor had noticed that his right leg wasn’t growing as fast as his left.  At the time we didn’t understand what that would mean but by the time we’d gotten to bring him home, we’d learned a bit about what it would mean for his future.  Nyx was born with PFFD, Proximal femoral focal deficiency, a tongue twister of a name which means that he was born with a shortened, missing or malformed limb.  In our little man’s case his right femur was significantly shorter than his left, his right hip dislocates on it’s own and his right knee pops each time he bends it, which weirds people out but doesn’t cause him discomfort.  {Note the difference in leg lengths here}He also has Syndactyly, a fancy word for conjoined digits, in both feet, but more predominant in his right foot; he has all of his toes, but on his right foot he has two sets of toes that are conjoined in varying degrees.  My older kids lovingly call these his “baby doll toes” and are fiercely protective of anyone staring or making fun of or threatening to “fix” his little toes.  My older kids, my husband and I love him just as God made him, but like all of us we’re also a work in progress for the glory of the Lord and we know that Pheonyx will face difficulties if his legs remain at different lengths in his future.     We had Pheonyx home for four weeks before those difficulties became a reality.  One night as I was getting him ready for bed and changing his onesie, I sat him forward and there was a horrible pop followed by Nyx screaming in pain.  My heart broke, I’d just hurt my baby.  I didn’t know what had happened, but my husband had also heard the pop and we knew it was more serious than his normal hip or knee pops so off to the ER we went.  After hours of waiting, an extremely tearful ultrasound, and being reassured that for him this was “normal” for Pheonyx, my husband demanded that the doctors x-ray his leg.  They did so grudgingly, only to come back shortly thereafter (and with a different doctor to boot) to tell us that he had in fact fractured his femur at the hip neck.  We were relieved to know what was wrong and rather appalled that they were just going to send us away without finding out what was really wrong.  He was fitted for a splint and would have to wear that until it “healed”, again not enough for us so a week later we were back in the doctor’s office asking for a cast so that he could have some protection from the everyday bumping etc that irritated it. So into a body cast he went, from nipples to ankle on the right side and to the knee on the left.  He was finally able to sleep comfortably, at least sort of, we had to hold him upright so he could sleep without the cast pressing into him.  It was a long and tiring three weeks before I suggested that it looked like he’d had a growth spurt and was looking kind of crammed into the cast, again another instance of parental intuition being keener than the medical staff.  After that we waited 6 more weeks before we got the good news of healthy bone regrowth and healing.  It was at this time that we also realized that he had inherited my bone disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta Type IV, which means we fracture very easily.  While in the orthopedist’s office we were told that it was his plan to amputate by his first birthday so that he wouldn’t remember the pain.  I was devastated, angry and confused, it wasn’t like his leg was completely useless or horribly malformed, it was just shorter.  How was I supposed to make that kind of decision for him? Pheonyx is a very happy, healthy, 10 month old who is learning to pull up on furniture, kneel, and get around in his own little army crawl sort of way.I like to say his shorter leg has personality, he’s able to “wave” with his foot, he loves to play with his toes and is more apt to grab the short leg. There had to be other options, I talked with my mother and she told me about Scottish Rites.  We got our pediatrician (who shares our view point not to amputate) to fill out a referral form, which we sent in in late April.  A week later we got a letter saying we were accepted and that our appointment would be a week after that.  We had to reschedule for June 27, 2016 as we couldn’t afford to make the trip this soon and unfortunately, we’ve also been struggling with car issues since before Nyx’s birth and now we know we’ll need to sell our car so we can get a vehicle that can accommodate a 14, 13, and 9 year old, a toddler, a stroller and possibly a wheelchair or walker and many miles going back and forth to Dallas, Texas from Arabi, Louisiana.  We also found the Paley Advanced Limb Lengthening Institute in Miami, Florida which will be another option if Scottish Rites doesn’t work out.  In the meantime, we’re trying to raise funds for a reliable minivan, travel expenses, medical expenses that aren’t covered by medicaid, and handicap accessibility devices/modifications that will make his life safe and as limitless as other kids.  Pheonyx’s first surgery  will be a hip reconstruction that will happen around his 2nd birthday, with surgeries to lengthen his legs likely to begin around his third or forth birthday, but he’ll rely on orthotic shoes to fill in the gap so he can walk and likely a walker, in many cases these are covered by insurance, but only so many and often we’ll have to buy specialized shoes to work with them that aren’t covered by insurance.  He’ll have a series of surgeries until he’s 14 or 15 and possibly beyond, but none of the people who have had this procedure done would say it’s not worth it and we feel that this is the best decision for our little man.  We need to start building Pheonyx’s Mobility Fund immediately so that we can continue to make his appointments in Dallas, the next of which will be September 2016 to meet his full surgical team, the prosthetist, & visit the amputation & leg lengthening clinics.This fund will also help to ensure that I can continue to stay at home and be there for Pheonyx as he gets therapy, learns sign language (he has possible hearing loss), and recovers, as child care costs are outside of my fixed income and Jason’s full time wages.  We thank everyone that helps us along the way and we look so forward to posting the story of how this little Pheonyx rose up to soar!  We praise the Lord for the opportunity to watch His glory be done! Needless to say we prayed ALOT!Daphny loves her baby brother!My first Mardi Gras!!Eating simi solids & the spoon!Chillin with big brother, GryphynSleeping with daddy!Right foot ""baby doll toes""Left foot.The rear view isn't bad, but you can see the heels don't line up.Right leg outstretched & TV changing channels!!Kissing his Mina!He's our superbaby!***UPDATE***We made it to Pheonyx's first appointment at Scottish Rites & found out from his doctors that his hip is in the socket and the pelic socket is growing almost normally.  His femoral head & hip will need some reconstruction to give him full range of motion & ensure that it can support his weight.  His ankle & foot are fine & will not require any surgery & his knee will be corrected by therapy as he gets older & can participate in physical therapy.  We were reassured that he's not in pain from any of his abnormalities & is a good candidate for either amputation or limb lengthening with the doctor wanting to try the lengthening over the amputation because his ankle, foot & knee are so good!  His hip surgery is going to be around his 2nd birthday with lengthening to begin around his 3rd or 4th birthdays.  Each lengthening will take about a year from surgery to recovery, so there will be a lot to deal with, but we know the Lord is working to make all of this possible & as painless as possible.  We will return to Scottish Rites in September 2016 to meet Nyx's surgical team, the prosthetist & start building our support teams through the amputation & limb lengthening clinics.  So excited to see all of this happening.  He's pulling up on furniture now & can stand while holding onto the furniture, while also using his little leg to climb/cling on to the furniture to help him move along!  He's too smart.  Praise God!Our Current Wish List:*minivan*Evenflo Symphony LX All-in-1 Convertible Car Seat, Harrison (Doctor recommended for support & padding)Thank you for reading and God bless!",Updates   19,https://www.gofundme.com/Pheonyx#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/Pheonyx#,,,

Teresa is an amazing person, and having a car would absolutely change her life. My sister was born with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)—or brittle bone syndrome, and has been the best role model a little sister could ask for. Our parents immigrated to the U.S. as refugees shortly before Teresa was born, and somehow beyond the language barrier and the social environment we grew up in, our parents managed to maintain her health, allowing her to achieve all of the great things that she’s accomplished in her life. First of all, she taught herself, and then our little brother and me how to speak English (as Vietnamese was our first language). As she paved the way for us through the education system, she successfully obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Integrated Physiology, and then a Master’s degree in Public Health. One of the many examples that proves the significant impact that Teresa has on her community includes being the first person with a disability to live on campus at her undergraduate University. This was only possible, because she worked hard to advocate for accommodations. Since then, the University has accommodated several others with disabilities to be able to live on campus while obtaining a University degree. She has taught me the value of strength and independence, and the importance of having a voice in issues that matter—such as the importance of healthcare transition. She has dedicated her career to this in order to help youth with disabilities manage their health and have the highest quality of life.Of course there are challenges that she faces just like all of us in life; recently, while she was commuting through the public transportation system to work, her ride came to too sudden of a stop, and both of her fragile legs broke at once. She needed emergency surgery, and is unable to return to work for at least a month. While Teresa is successfully employed, having a disability comes with many financial challenges most people don’t have to think twice about. Her salary upkeeps her health and keeps a roof over her head, while transportation costs often get pushed aside in financial priorities.I want to take this opportunity to see if we can come together to assist in providing Teresa with her own accessible vehicle, that would increase her independence in a way to allow her to continue impacting her community.**please note that Teresa has a driver's license, however has not been able to purchase her own vehicle due to costs**Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. ￼",,,https://www.gofundme.com/pimp-teresas-ride#,,,

We arrived at the hospital, monitors were attached and Jordan's heartbeat was strong. Vitals all normal. We were wheeled to the back and we prepared to meet Jordan for the very first time. Jordan took his first breath and cried, but then there was chaos. Right as Jordan was detached from my placenta his little heart stopped and Jordan took his last breath. Not knowing Jordan's condition the Dr's began to recessitate. Jordan made it back to us. We found out later Jordan had a rare condition called osteogenesis imperfecta II also known as Brittle Bone Disease. Jordan suffered multiple fractures during labor, broken limbs and skull fractures from delivery. Jordan suffered broken ribs and internal bleeding due to being recessitated. Dr's informed us the disease is very rare and was not genetically inherited and nothing we did caused it.  And there was nothing we could've done to prevent it. Unfortunately there was also nothing we could do to cure it either. Jordan was in NICU and placed on life support. We were able to spend time with Jordan until his last breath at 12:30AM on October 3rd. Now we are faced with having to plan a funeral. As most of you know funerals are quite costly and cost a whole lot more than a crib which is what we had in our budget.

If Kelly can get through her challenges, then surely I can too.  I am sure I am not the only one who feels this way. Kelly never asks for anything; she sees that as a sign of weakness. I was shocked she was willing to let me start this Go Fund Me page, but so glad she said yes.  She really needs our help now, so I am asking on her behalf.  Kelly was in a car accident on Friday, 11/4, which injured her and her son, and totaled her Modified 2000 Chevrolet Venture.  Her car, modified with a wheelchair lift, hand controls and hydraulic seat base, is critical to her livelihood.  It’s costly - a niche vehicle which can't be purchased anywhere.  Can you imagine Kelly without her wheels?  I sure cant!  Will you please help Kelly continue to be the lady that inspires each of us when we are down, and super mom to Drake?

I have never asked anyone for help before, and I still do not feel right doing so. I just know it would be selfish of me not to, when my family needs it so desperately. I also have not ever shared our story before, and that is where I will start.Six years ago I moved nearly 200 miles away from my very supportive family to attend school, which was very sad for me. Although I visit as often as I can, I still get home sick. I am in college working towards a PhD in research biology. My biggest dream is to someday be a zoologist working on the conservation of endangered animals.  Four and a half years ago I had a beautiful baby girl, her name is Addalee. I raised Addalee as a single mother, while her father lived in a different state. It was difficult being so far away from my family while caring for my baby alone and attending school. There was one thing that made everything much harder than just being alone though, Addalee was born with a rare bone condition. She has osteogenesis imperfecta which is the brittle bone disease. Her bones break very easily sometimes without any impact. She has broken eight major bones so far in her short life.Two years ago I met Kenny, and he later became my fiancé. He helps me and Addalee a lot, he always supports us and helps us through our hard times. Along with Kenny came my three beautiful soon to be step-daughters. McKenna is five and she will be starting kindergarten in two months. Addison is four, Olivia is the baby she is just two years old. So, together Kenny and I have four little girls five years old and younger.  We have a full home and even fuller hearts, we love our little girls ever so much.That is our story. Now that you know my family, I will explain our struggle.In the past two years Addalee has broken her right leg four times, once every six months. First, she broke her tibia and fibula, by simply twisting her ankle at daycare.  Her leg was placed in a cast until it was healed. Then after that she had to begin physical therapy to learn how to walk again, because she could not walk at all anymore. Next, Addie broke her tibia and fibula again in the very same place by getting pushed down by a little boy on the playground. She had a surgery to put two pins in her leg and had a cast that went up to her mid-thigh. Each time she experienced a lot of regression while she was in the casts. She was toilet trained before the break, but while she was immobilized she had to go back to using diapers. Her leg healed very crooked that time and her surgeon told me “next time it breaks we might get it straight.” It’s heartbreaking to have to expect her to go through all of this pain. After that cast came off the doctors told us she was okay to start learning how to walk again. One week later she was walking across our living room with her three sisters, it had been so long since we had seen her walk. It was on McKenna’s fifth birthday and we were building the new doll house we bought. While she was walking her leg just gave out from underneath her and blew out to the side. I had to pick her up, while I was crying with her, carry her to the van, buckle her in, and drive her to the emergency room. She was convulsing, quivering, and screaming in pain the entire time. Sure enough for a third time she broke her tibia and fibula in the same place. This time I asked to be transferred to a different hospital, one that would be more experienced taking care of children with her condition. We went three hours away to a children’s hospital and met her new surgeon. She put a telescoping rod down the center of Addalee’s tibia to give it strength and make sure that it would heal straight. We were so appreciative of her and very glad to meet her. Her leg healed much better that time. After her cast came off and she resumed therapy to start walking again we discovered that that the year and a half she had spent in a cast had taken a hard toll on her body. She could only limp with her foot sticking all the way out to the right, but her therapists are wonderful and they work so hard with her. That brings us to May 28th when she was playing with her neighbor and slipped on a wet porch. She had broken her femur, the largest bone in her body. We were taken three hours by ambulance to go to the children’s hospital where her surgeon works. I was not at all prepared for what I would see the next morning. She went in for a three hour surgery to have a second rod placed in her right leg, this time in her femur. When she came out she was in the biggest cast I have ever seen in my life. Her cast went from her foot all the way up to her chest. She couldn’t do anything; couldn’t move, sit up, go to the bathroom, wear clothes, go to her preschool, take a bath, get her hair brushed, sit in a car seat, nothing. I just cried for her, she is four, it is not fair to make a four year old lay in one single place for six weeks. We figured it out though, we got a reclining car seat for the van to transport her, a wheel chair that reclines to let her move around, and my mom even got a hospital bed to keep her more comfortable. She was even able to go to her preschool for the last couple weeks, (after she was off of her narcotics) with the help of her amazing one on one aid that works with her. A few days ago we had her giant cast sawed off, which is so scary for her, she said “I want to keep it on forever.” She is so brave and so strong, she already wants to start walking on that leg again, and she has a cute pink walker to help her. Her scares are very big, and her skin is very sore from having that cast on for so long, and she scratches her leg too which just makes it bleed. Overall it is a big struggle each time she breaks, but it goes beyond the break it’s self it always causes a lot of residual hardships that most people would not even think of.  We have made it through this break though, and right now she is completely healed and recovering well, we are blessed. However, this break and the ones that came before it have had effects on each of us. We all continue to go through hardships.Addalee is behind in attendance at her preschool and if she misses too much school she will not be able to continue in her program. Also we are behind in payments to her preschool.I am also behind in college, multiple semesters I have had to drop out of my classes to be able to better care for Addalee when she is broken. This has caused me to get suspended for one semester. That set us back finically because I use my student loans to pay for our bills.Kenny, my fiancé was fired from his job that he has been at for four years, for attendance. He is often having to take off to travel three hours to go to Addalee’s doctor, and calling in when she is hurt. This really set us back financially because that is our only income, and we were already behind before he was fired.We are so far behind financially that we do not know what to do. We are both looking for jobs 200 miles away and thinking about moving back to the city where my family lives to stay with them, so they can watch Addalee while we both work to get caught up. However it is very hard to look for jobs and travel back and fourth when we can’t even afford gas. We still have to travel to follow up appointments with her surgeon, and for therapy appointments. Also our phones and internet are going to be shut off which will make it difficult to contact anyone. The hardest part though will be losing our van, which holds her wheel chair, walker, and special car seat, and losing our rental home. We can’t even afford the insurance for the van that will be due in a few days. Also our electricity and our water were just shut off, but my mom paid enough to get them turned back on for us. Our family has been helping as much as they can, and that has been the only thing keeping us a float, but they don’t have very much to give in the first place. Additionally we pay a large amount of money each month to my step children’s mother for support for them, and that is a large portion of their house hold income, therefore their lives are not only being hindered at our home they are hindered at their mother’s home as well.  It was difficult already to support our family of six, but now it just seem impossible. We don’t know what else to do, that is why we have turned to you.I know that you are more than likely a stranger to me, but I desperately need your help, so I can help my family. I know we will have jobs soon, we just need help for right now to get caught up and to keep our home and our van.  So, if there is anything you can do to help us, please do. If you have any advice for us of things that we could do to help ourselves, please let us know. We would be so very thankfully for any and all help that we are able to receive. Thank you so much for reading my letter and God bless you.  Ashley Logsdon",,,https://www.gofundme.com/ymrfas#,,,

One of the doctors had suspected abuse, however there was another doc there that said “there has to be something else going on, I don’t believe he’s being abused”.  This doctor was smart enough to check my eyes and noticed that the whites were blue. That was a sign that I had osteogenesis imperfecta, aka, OI. Over the next several years the I had broken several more bones, averaging 2-3 per year. I never never got to compete in all the sports I loved. So, the years pass and as I stop growing the broken bones slow down for a while.  Now, even though I wasn’t actively breaking bones in my body, I had taken a lot of damage from all of the breaks and surgeries, plus I had severely hurt my back which slowed life down almost to a mind numbing feeling. Now I have two amazing kids of my own. My son was born with OI, but fortunately his case is nowhere near as bad as mine. I want to train and ride on cycling races to have a goal set that I can keep.

She is a bright and charming young lady despite a lifetime of challenges. Kally was born June, 2006 with a condition called osteogenesis imperfecta , or OI. Many people have only heard of this condition in it’s more mild form, being described as brittle bones. The severity of Kally’s OI has resulted in hundreds of breaks over her young life. Her physical development has been affected which has limited her growth and ability to move and play, go to school, and explore her world like other children. Her positive attitude, despite the pain she lives with, is an inspiration. On July 17th, Kally took a little tumble. While this could easily be fixed by a quick hug in most children, it resulted in serious breaks in both of Kally’s legs. Her parents rushed her to Grand Itasca Hospital in Grand Rapids, Minnesota but they were unable to treat her. Kally’s OI doctors in Omaha, Nebraska sent a plane and a specialist team to pick Kally up and bring her to the Children’s Hospital in Omaha where she will undergo surgery. Kally’s mother, Kara, was able to fly with Kally and be there to support her. Her father, Justin, traveled by car to meet them there. Her Grandma D. and her sister Kaitlyn are also on their way to support Kally. Her younger brother, Kody, stayed behind with his Grandmother and Grandfather Lokken along with her older brother, Chanler. Kally’s struggle with OI has resulted in significant expenses that the family has dealt with over the years. The Lokkens will face many financial hardships as Kally receives treatment in Omaha, including the travel expenses, lodging, meals, and the loss of income for both parents as they support their daughter. Please help support this loving family and brave young lady!

She loves horses, books and getting letters in the mail.  Lorelai is also one of the strongest little girls, even though her bones are just the opposite.  Lorelai has osteogenesis imperfecta aka “brittle bones”.  Her life is often unpredictable.  Her bones could break just from the pressure of her standing up or the force of vomiting while she has the flu.  Each break is different, different limitations and different pain.  She has pain that is not even caused by the breaks at times, just bone pain. Lorelai has a wheelchair that she uses and is growing out of.  Recently they went to see her special needs doctor to start the process to get a new wheelchair. One of conditions of her wheelchair being approved is her using it in the house.  She will have to use her chair in the house as well as during  her everyday life.  Lorelai is almost 90 pounds, carrying her in and out of the house is very hard on her parents; therefore a wheelchair ramp is needed.  The Burke’s have applied for funds from the state and to everyone’s surprise, including the doctor’s, they have been denied twice.   Her parents have tried several different approaches, grants, groups, etc.  With each denial, their hopes have slowly been depleted.Over the past couple of months, we have been working with Home Depot in Sheboygan to work with their vendors to get us a plan and materials, at cost, to build the ramp.  In addition, when we had builders out doing the measurements and figuring out a way to do the ramp, the driveway space came up.  With how the ramp will go, this cuts into the driveway space.  If the family leaves it as is, it’s a tight fit to get the van into the drive way and be able to get out and such. The funds that are raised will go for these materials as well, along with any permits needed for the projects. This is not a matter of a cosmetic enhancement to the house, but a daily functionality of this child’s life.  We would love to give this gift to them with your help!Thank you",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/ramp-it-up-for-lorelai#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/ramp-it-up-for-lorelai#,,,

Things have been going very well other than getting him in and out of the house. Picking up Ricky to go up and down the steps has not only put a strain on our backs but also limits independence for Ricky. His chair is approximately 300lb.

_____________________________________________My Story




Sadly, this is the third GoFundMe I've had and I'll explain why.  Nothing hurts me more than feeling helpless but lately life has been pressing me down everytime I climb back up. 




Firstly, years ago, I had a GoFundMe that got me a handicap accessible mini-van.  This helped me get the vehicle that allowed me to get a job and get to much needed medical appointment.




Then - last year I suffered two gran mal seizures that put me on life support for a week, caused four fractures which brought surgery and partial paralysis on my left arm.  With that I was on bed rest for six months, followed by another six months of rehab.  I went through tons of hospital stays, blood tests, CAT scans, MRI's - all to find out I have Epilepsy on top of my osteogenesis imperfecta. That's just the spark notes version of it.Now, Monday, February 5th 2018, I went into the hospital via an ambulance after having a petite gran mal seizure from having influenza A. I was admitted with a severe blood co2 level among other things like being observed for neurotic reasons. On that night, at 2:04 in the morning, I coded and was in complete cardiac and respiratory arrest. My family was pulled away and were told I had no palse and the nurse wasn't hopeful.I miraculously was revived after 8 minutes lifeless on the hospital bed. I woke up two days later with a breathing and feeding tube. I had multiple bone fractures as well and was being kept sedated by propofol and under heavy pain medication. Doctors worked hard to figure what if anything could bring me back to normal or if I'd even be able to speak again.Now...two weeks later I am off life support and breathing on my own and just returned home today. Somehow, I am on the mend it appears. I am broken, sick, confused and frankly I'm feeling depressed and disgusted with the cards of my life but I am still here.A lot is still wrong, I'm still sick and broken and there are more questions than answers. But I am using this GoFundMe because again I need help.I'm going to be out of work again for months and I've still after a year trying to get SSI disability.  I need the money to help cover many of the equipments I'll need that my insurance won't cover, the copays and the just plain 'ol living expenses I need since I have no income at all right now.




If you can find it in your heart to donate, I would thank you so much.  If you can't, please help me spread the story?  I need help - I'm so sick of all that's happening...I'm hoping a break happens soon.",,,https://www.gofundme.com/seans-medical-recovery-fund-2018#,,,

Sebastian has a condition called OI, or osteogenesis imperfectaosteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, is a congenital bone disorder characterized by brittle bones that are prone to fracture. People with OI are born with defective connective tissue, or without the ability to make it, usually because of a deficiency of type I collagen. Eight types of OI can be distinguished. Most cases are caused by mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes. There is no cure for OI. Treatment is aimed at increasing overall bone strength to prevent fracture and maintain mobility. OI occurs in about one per 20,000 live births.Sebastian is entering his early teens and I want to raise enough money to get him an outdoor chair lift for our home, that with such, Sebastian will have the freedom to enter and exit his home with ease. As of now, my family, my brothers, and myself personally carry Sebastian in and out of our home for school and other social events. As Sebastian is growing faster with the premtive steps taken by my mother in using expiremental drugs and surgery to give sebastian the best chance to walk some day we need to take action to ensure the best possible life for him. Hand carrying Sebastian leaves him prone to a severe injury from something as simple as a misstep walking up the stairs, therefore the most feasible way for me to raise this money, and to help Sebastian, is to turn to the generosity and compassion of the general public and ask you to share this GoFundMe.

My name is Evgenia Barannikova. I am trying to collect the money for my younger brother Sergey to complete the orthopedic rehabilitation after multiple surgeries done to ease his rare and incurable bone disease osteogenesis imperfecta. From his birth and until now, he has been on wheelchair since his bones are very fragile. He went through multiple surgeries of inserting titanium rods into his long bones of legs and hands, which is the most common way to support bone strength for this type of disease. It helped him a lot since even when the bone breaks, it is not as painful and heals faster.  We still hope that one day he will be able to walk even with help of crutches. My brother lives in Voronezh, Russia. My family tried to find rehabilitation programs there, but there is no appropriate set up for his conditions. Fortunately, I live in Baltimore, USA, the location of many advanced medical facilities devoted to help people with such disease, such as osteogenesis imperfecta Clinic at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and University of Maryland Rehabilitation and Orthopaedic Institute.  My family and I can come up with money for his traveling and living expenses, but medical bills is something that we will need your help. We plan to schedule Sergey’s arrival to Baltimore for March, where he will meet with medical team at the osteogenesis imperfecta Clinic at the Kennedy Krieger Institute to obtain referrals for the following treatment.

I was raised in a large family with all able bodied people, they never allowed me to give up so Ive become a very strong individual. Ive endured horrific accidents and have broken practically every bone in my body many times. Ive also survived an abusive marriage, this is where my two beautiful step daughters come in. They also are survivors. I have donated my time for years helping children. I play guitar and sing professionally, its a gift from God considering the many times Ive fractured my wrists, hands fingers, I refuse to give up even though my body would like to do . I have been Home bound since 2008, always depending on others when others always have depended on me, Iam a natural caretaker. Since 2008 I severely fractured both ankles and broke the fusion in my right ankle, broke the metal in my knees, All the graftings and surgeries Shriners Hospital did I have torn and theres nothing they can do, so I am unable to get behind the wheel of my van. Ive always been independent , Im always on the look out for the ex-husband who is now out of prison that he and his father want to finish what they started. I plug along, I dont want others to pity me or feel sorry. The last few years I severley broke my thigh, the doc (what an angel) had to scoop the bone out, and he saved my leg, then I broke my ankle (again) and my right shoulder, oh how I missed playing my guitar, but I could still sing and Im back to playing and singing, I have guitar students that I volunteer teaching, I perform for benefits, but I still have to depend on others to get me to where I need to be......this is where I need help in transportation, Im on a list to be helped on getting a wheelchair accessible vehicle but I have to come up with half the money.......I was just diagnoised with RA and I have post polio syndrome, osteo arthritus, advanced osteoporosis, I was run down in a walkway in front of Disneyland in 1976, by a drunk driver, he killed me but it wasnt my time, my pelvic, ribs spine were broken, estimated speed 60mph, My first OBE...in 1978 I was rearended on a freeway on ramp by a drunk driver I nearly lost my right leg, Everyone walked away but me. In 1991 I was in a head on collision with a propane crane truck in my driveway and this is where all the injustice you could ever imagine could and did happen. I was in a 1964 econoline van, you have to remember I was still walking, limping disabled person  both legs were severed from my knees and my left arm was broken and the bones had come out of my hand. I lost all my blood they still dont know how I survived but I know it was by the grace of God. I went through a harder time through the court system and how I was treated going up a gainst a big corporation, it was a joke and Ive suffered, but because of the bone disease its hard to defend someone, oh well...another day in a glass persons life. I was up and walking in 3 months on my own legs another divine intervention and the two years later my dogs knocked me down shattering my legs and arm whoops, love them dogs. I always have had animals whether they be animals dropped off in my yard or feral cats or family or friends that need a good home, here Iam. So this is why Im unable to use my legs like standing or walking, when the physician recieved me in the er he didnt know what my leg looked like since it was mush and he decided to reshape my leg into a normal leg, well Im not normal, so what the heck?  As I was recouping a man from my church introduced me to his son, I was too involved when the abuse began, he would beat me around my head and arms and legs, everytime I tried to escape he knew my every thought, I was in a wheelchair, I would manage to get in my truck he would chase me down in his bigger truck and tried pushing me and my truck off an 800 foot embankment. I lived in the mountains where law was a good two hours away. This man would hide me out all battered and since I was in a chair people just assumed I had been in an accident, when I would cry out for help my husband would beat them up, I was terrified of him. Nothing I did, I couldnt look at him and when he aimed a shotgun at his father and shot him I thought for sure I was going to be saved but no help ever came. Theres so much more but this is where the wonderful came in I got to raise and save two beautiful little girls who are now two beautiful young women, strong, healthy survivors they were witness to this. I have a beautiful grandson and another on the way and this is where I say thank you God...I survived and Im going to keep on doing what I do and that is LOVE!",Updates   7,https://www.gofundme.com/2a3zy59c#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/2a3zy59c#,,,

For several years his parents, Jeff and Allison Silver, tried to start a family and finally they were pregnant with this little miracle. During the pregnancy they realized there were some complications and he was not progressing normally. Still, Jeff and Allison couldn’t wait to be parents and Samuel was born on August 7, 2015 with an incredibly rare genetic condition called osteogenesis imperfecta. He is type III which is the most severe among children that do survive. Since Samuel was born he has endured:-Two major surgeries one of which led to pneumonia and a blood infection.-About ten broken bones including his skull, femurs, tibias, humerus, and ribs.-Kyphosis and stenosis of his spine.-A neck brace to protect his spine when moved or held.-Many different therapies including physical therapies and infusions of pamidronate to strengthen his bones.-Feeding tube after only being able to gain a little more than 3 pounds in the last 8 months.Unfortunately, there is no cure and he will always be thrown challenges. The reality is that he will have to endure much more. Samuel fought hard to survive and now he is here with a big smile on his face reminding all of us to forge ahead despite the obstacles. Allison and Jeff will stop at nothing to give him everything he needs. Almost everyday of the week there is another appointment, another long drive to a doctor who specializes in one aspect of this terrible disease, another expense, another medical bill. Can you imagine not being able to hug your child for fear of breaking his bones? Can you imagine being worried about your child coughing because the force may make him break his own bones?

She was going to be the next Barbara Walters, chasing stories near and far. To do that, she needed a car. Priscilla was 2’10 and had a rare disorder called osteogenesis Imperfecta aka, Brittle Bones. This meant that she was not strong at all and her bones would break or crack in an instant. But the only thing small about Priscilla was her stature. She had a loud, authoritative voice and a presence that made her shine. Anything she wanted to do, she did, no matter how much effort it took. Getting a car was a massive undertaking. It took 4 years, dozens of phone calls, rejections from adaptive car companies who “just didn’t know how to make this work,” and ultimately 70 hours of behind-the-wheel training to get the vehicle you see here. It is controlled with $80000 worth of equipment in a touchscreen, 8 different computers, and a highly specialized integrated system. This was going to be the News Mobile of the future and make her independent beyond anything she could have hoped for.  Life has a way of throwing curve balls when they are least expected. In November 2011, Priscilla fell out of her wheelchair, broke 8 bones, and, two days later, had a massive stroke on her left side. She had to relearn how to speak, write, read, and get used to slower cognitive processes. This meant that reporting and quickly saying people's names was not going to be her future career. This did not deter her from pursuing other avenues of employment and her car continued to be an invaluable asset. even if the computers malfunctioned occasionally. Unfortunately, in May 2017, Priscilla's health was failing rapidly. She passed away of a brain aneurysm on May 25.I now have her car which I have been trying to sell unsuccessfully for the past year. This is because the adaptions (computers, touchscreen, special steering, etc.) are far too specific for anybody except Priscilla to use and require a medical prescription. This is where I need your help. I need to raise money to take these adaptions out so that I can sell the car as though it were a ""regular"" wheelchair van. The van has a side entry ramp and I have the original driver’s seat and gear shift. There is one company, Performance Mobility, in the state of Colorado that can take this equipment out. There is also only one person who is certified to do it in the state of Colorado who works at that company. The ability for me to convert the van back into a ""regular"" wheelchair van will enable me to sell it and not only pay off the loan that Priscilla had to take out to pay for the van but will also make someone as independent as Priscilla was. It is easier for someone of average size and strength to adapt a car with hand controls. The equipment that Priscilla had was made by Electronic Mobility Controls of Maine which meant that any time they malfunctioned, they had to be shipped out east to be repaired. If the van is converted back to a regular wheelchair van, there are dozens of companies that adapt them to suit every configuration. The Division of Vocational Rehabilitation paid the $80,000 for the adaptions. They will not pay to have them removed because Priscilla's case was closed after she found successful employment in 2013. The $11,000 that I need to raise will cover approximately 60 hours of labor as estimated by Performance Mobility to remove the equipment. Every component is integrated into the engine of the car and the Low Effort Steering system which was put in so that Priscilla could steer the vehicle with a minimal amount of strength needs to be replaced with the conventional steering.I thank you for any donation you can provide as soon as possible. Please feel free to share this on your social media feeds so that others can hear the story of the amazing Priscilla Carlson. Her legacy lives on in this van, we need to get it back on the road so that someone can carry on her work of social justice and advocacy for persons with disabilities.Thank you,Sincerely,Dave Bahr",,,https://www.gofundme.com/5jp03mg#,,,

My name is Tatum, and I'm 4yrs old. I was born with OI (osteogenesis imperfecta) My bones are made of glass. My Mommy and Big Brother have it too. There is no cure for OI, so I have to be extra careful when I play with my friends. I fall a lot. I've had a lot of broken bones, my teeth hurt a lot, and I've bumped my head from falling so many times I can't remember., I'm starting to fall more often lately. I have a special leg that's about 3inches shorter than my right leg. My foot doesn't bend so my heel can't touch the ground. So, I have to walk on my tip toes on my left side. My foot is starting to roll over because I'm growing bigger. I now walk on the side of my pinky toe. It's causing my limp to get really bad and my hip to get out of place. The doctors call it Leg Length Discrepancy. And the bigger I get the worse it gets. I need a bunch of special surgeries that my family can't afford and now my Mommy has to stay home with me and not go to her job anymore. I can't stay at my Child care place anymore because they said I was a big liability. Please help my family get my leg fixed. Thank You...... Tatum           My Family Needs Your Help! This is just the start for Tatum. He was born with a rare disease osteogenesis imperfecta (type All) Brittle Bone Disorder, causing his bones to break. He's Highly Asthmatic, and has Leg Length Discrepancy. It has brought him to this journey in life that decides if he can have a chance to walk normal, or not. His insurance barely covers anything. We need to leave the state quite a few times to see his physicians at Philadelphia Shriners Hospital for Children and Boston Children's Hospital . I NEED YOUR HELP to make this journey possible for my child! We have been approved for Angel Flight of Ga, which provides a private pilot to and from appointments (weather permitting) but we have to have another way on Flight Transportation. We can't do flights with them because they need a very big notice. If Tatum breaks something or has any issues, we have to leave right away. I have no way of getting him there. Shriners will cover our medical, overnight stay, taxi from airport, and food. Not Travel without 30days notice. Boston covers 0%. Tatum has to go every 2weeks for the next 2mths @Shriners in Philadelphia to change out his cast and also get a tendon procedure done where they cut the back of the heel to bring it down.  After they get his heel to come down, he will have his first major surgeries on his leg & foot. We applied 2years ago for Disability;  Still its always another phone call from a different case worker stating he needs more medical evaluations from SSI doctors, or if I call their mailbox is full. We have reached out to Foundations, Organazations that could help. We've applied for medical grants, you name it. They just don't hand them out. He is waiting to be approved, his case reviewed, waiting list, and other factors. With 3 boys, 9mths, 14yrs, 4 and myself that's a lot of stress. His story/Our story is below. You can read it threw my eyes the way I see how my child needs me to be his voice when he has no one. PLEASE, TAKE A FEW MORE MOMENTS TO READ AND DECIDE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HELP US WITH OUR LIFE STRUGGLES...  Half the time I don't know what to say? He doesn't understand fully that he has a disability. He knows there is something wrong with his body, but can't understand why?  And even if you tell him, He can't comprehend the severity of it. Tatum is a very active 4yr old little boy who is full of life. He goes non stop 24/7 even though his leg and foot is hurting. I don't know how he does it? He needs major surgeries on his left leg, ankle, foot starting right now. Its going to take a lot of time and money to keep our family together. Physical theraphy, special lift shoes, after care for preventing infections, and much more. Tatum's First Big Surgery He Needs... With external devices, pins and rods are inserted. They provide a path right into the bone. The screws in the external leg-lengthening device are turned several times a day to lengthen the bone, but the fasciia, muscles and tendons, require regular physical therapy to stretch and keep pace with the lengthening. The internal fixator significantly reduces the infection risk posed by external devices but still requires months of healing and lengthening. Myself and my 14yr old suffer greatly from this disease as well. osteogenesis imperfecta is a rare disease with no cure and its hell on the inside and out. I've lost count on how many bones I've broken. It is really like being made of glass. It is a daily battle for me just keep it together for my children. I have no choice but to be strong for them. But how in the world can I continue to do that when I can't be strong for myself sometimes? I have moments where I lose myself and just pray for strength to function. I love my children more than anything in this world and if I gotta move mountains to help them have a normal life, I will dang sure try. I will reach out to anyone who is willing to help me move that mountain, give me advice or just wants to pray for us. Bullying is such a big factor these days and kids with low self esteem suffer big time. I am faced now with a life situation that I can't avoid, that I can't afford and I can't handle by myself. This is a debt that I can not pay back. All I can do is say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart and God Bless You All. Thank you for helping me when I have no way to support my children's needs. Thank You for your compassion and understanding life's struggles.  THANK YOU.... The picture below is Tatum right before he hit a growth spurt. Just less then a year ago. As you see his legs bow in and he leans to the side. THIS PICTURE IS NOW..Tatum's Big Brother Jesse.........(Pectus Carinatum) its the deformity in his chest.

He has dealt with pain his whole life. As a young boy he was thought to have arthritis and brittle bones disease.After breaking his leg several times he became infected with gangrene. At this point Doctors wanted to amputate his leg.  His parents decided to not go thru with it. From then on he lived life with one leg being permanently shorter than the other. He found out many years later he has a rare disease called Maffucci’s disease.                Struggles continued throughout his life as he faced many surgeries. Some of the surgeries included knee surgeries, shoulder surgeries, hip surgery, and two back surgeries. Several years ago Ted lost his lower leg due to cancer. The last couple years he has had nonstop excruciating pain. Doctors told him it was due to a bone to bone hip. Due to his disease he would have to live with chronic pain because surgery was too risky.                 In late January 2017 Ted stepped into his van and heard a “cracking” sound in his hip. He was taken by ambulance to St. Agnes hospital and given a CT scan to see what happened. There was in fact a hip fracture but the root to his horrible pain was discovered that he had a huge mass that was wrapping around his upper leg to his groin. The mass was a fast growing, aggressive cancer that was growing into his bone.  After three weeks at St. Agnes, and countless doctors denying treatment because of being a high risk.He was accepted to Stanford University for treatment. Beating the odds he survived the 12 hour surgery. He was sent from there to a nursing home to recover. While in the nursing home he developed an infection in his huge incision. Now he is back at Stanford after having to get his wound re-opened and cleaned out. He is on an IV with anti- biotics for the infection.                He has overcome huge hurdles; however the future doesn’t look much easier.  On top of thousands of dollars in medical bills from his long stay in hospitals, he will now need to go back to a nursing home to recover and have to be transported daily for 8 weeks of radiation. The expenses don’t stop there. Once Ted is recovered enough to finally go home, he will need IN home care that their insurance will not cover. Also, he will need things like a wheel chair, medical bed and a shower accessible for his needs, etc. Any donation will be appreciated and if you cannot donate please keep him in your prayers.",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/ted-boyettmedical-expenses#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/ted-boyettmedical-expenses#,,,

My name is Christine & I'm trying to raise money for a brand new vehicle for my daughter Haley Jean & I. I've always wanted to learn to drive to be more independent & self-sufficient. A vehicle that is custom made to transport my wheelchair will be wonderful. Before my mother went to be with the Lord, she bought pedal extensions for me. After she died, I lost the interest to learn. Since my daughter was born, I've had to learn to adapt to her needs, adjust my lifestyle so that we can live in a world that just wasn't made for us. My mother always taught me how to be independent & by living in an unaccessible two-flat apartment for years was a lesson in itself.  I'm a single mother, disabled & so is my daughter. I was born with a rare bone condition called osteogenesis imperfecta or brittle bones disorder. It causes bones to break or fracture with little & sometimes no trauma at all. I'm completely wheelchair dependent & require assistance traveling. My daughter Haley Jean has inherited the disorder as well. After 6 months of being in the NICU she was finally discharged home with some health issues, some that aren't  directly OI related gives us hope of a bright & productive future. She's dependent on oxygen 24/7 & is alternatively fed. I've done my best to provide a safe homelife for her & myself. I work temporarily as a Contract Paralegal, but as the job is ""seasonal"" or on-call, it's difficult to make ends meet. My sister is my caregiver who & helps me with everyday tasks around the house. Traveling is especially challenging for me alone. Because public transportation isn't safe for either of us it has become rather difficult living in a suburban area. I'm a college graduate & have mounting student loans. So buying a car is neccessary, yet a long term goal due to finances beyond my reach. Haley Jean requires doctors appointments frequently & with inadequate transportation I have to rely on shared services to drive us. A new vehicle that is safe, reliable & custom made will be the greatest blessing to us all.We would need something that can transport my wheelchair & Haley Jean's special made car bed. We are most thankful in advance for any type of assistance. Please share our story. Any donation is appreciated beyond measure & prayers are the best gift we could imagine.

After two weeks of being in a Pavlik brace, her left thigh healed, thankfully.  She has been diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta. 




We found out that Eva had this condition at her 35th week ultrasound. As you can imagine, it was traumatic, especially thinking that our little girl was in pain.




osteogenesis imperfecta is also known as Brittle Bones Disease. If you have ever seen the movie ""Unbreakable,"" you know that Samuel L. Jackson's character suffers from Type 1 OI, the mildest form, although any Type 1 person would tell you that his character's OI was not mild in the slightest.  Also, there is the ""Glass Man"" in the movie ""Amelie."" Kid President suffers from ""Type 3, severe."" And, Atticus Shaffer from ""The Middle"" has Type 1 inherited from his mother, but has been clinically diagnosed as Type 4. People with OI have frequent fractures and bone breaks because of a collagen deficiency, sometimes requiring them to have rodding surgeries. Some people with OI also have Scoliosis, and are in need of spinal fusions and rodding in their spines.




Clinically, our daughter has been diagnosed with moderate OI, but we are still waiting for molecular results and are hopeful that she has Type 1 OI, the mildest form, potentially passed from her father, who may be asymptomatic. There is not a known family history, but it's likely, considering that members of his family have Dentinogenesis imperfecta, which often accompanies OI.  Dentinogenesis imperfecta is similar to OI, except it occurs in teeth. Both OI and DI are dominant with a 50% chance of passing the conditions onto the child.




As soon as she was born, we began applying for federal assistance, but constantly had doors closed on us.  We do not qualify for SSI, we do not qualify for PeachCare, nor do we qualify for Medicaid. Even though there is a disability, we do not qualify based on need.  However, based on our debt, we should qualify:  car loans, house loans, school loans.




We want to make sure that our daughter has the best chance to live a full, independent, productive life. We want her to be able to walk. We want to provide for her every surgery necessary to make sure that it's possible for her to achieve every dream, every aspiration. However, we cannot do it without financial help. Rodding surgeries, adaptive equipment, and the treatment of DI are all very expensive.  Unfortunately, our insurance coverage is not the best.





Since her birth, one compression fracture has been found in her spine. However, due to her early treatment with the bisphosphonate, Pamidronate, we are hopeful that it will load her spine and reform it properly and reduce her risk of Scoliosis. 




We need to prepare for the possibilities of future fractures because of the clinical diagnosis of moderate OI, the inevitability of future fractures, and the likelihood she will also have Dentinogenesis imperfecta.




Thank you so much for your help.",Updates   21,https://www.gofundme.com/OIBelieveInEva#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/OIBelieveInEva#,,,

One thing is phisical therapy to strenghten his core muscles to help reduce the risk of fracture. Another is the genetic testing to determine the exact type of OI that he has.  One of Theons main issues is eating as his ADHD symptoms make sitting still hard and the OI makes chewing painful.  One of the adaptive devices we want is a high chair that is padded and strong enough for when he has a (wiggle) moment that he wont hurt himself or break the chair.  Sleeping is also an issue as he has a basic spring toddler mattress and it is not very supportive for the spine and he already has scoliosis related to the OI.  He wakes up several times complaining about the pian and I think a more comfortable bed will help him get the sleep he needs. Theon has two big Sisters a loving Father and Me (Mom).  We all are worried that if we can’t get his medical needs met soon his condition will worsen causing him more pain.  Any help would mean the world to us and will literally change his life!",Updates   10,https://www.gofundme.com/theonfragilebutferocious#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/theonfragilebutferocious#,,,

(also known as brittle bone disease) get in the way of giving me everything I ever needed growing up. Over the years he's done so much and gone so far to make sure that I was always happy and comfortable, sometimes spending money he didn't even have, just to put even a momentary smile on my face. 




He's getting a bit older now, especially for someone with our disability, having turned 60 in September, and I know that the time that we have together is limited, and with the degrading state of my back, neck, and spine I don't feel like I have a whole lot of time left either that I'll be physically mobile, independent, and able to do things with and for him. 




That's why I need all of your help to raise money for the things he wishes for most so that he and I can live much more securely and comfortably with the time we do have left, and I'd really like to make this year special for him! Two years ago our air conditioner broke down completely, and last year we tried a window unit, but it costs way too much in energy bills to run it another summer. We've been trying to get financing for a new air conditioner but with our hospital bills and other debts, we can't find any lenders, and with the small amount we get in Social Security, it's barely enough to live on, let alone pay any of these off. 




With this money, 
• We'll be paying off our hospital bills and other debts 
• Getting a new AC for the house
• Repairing the dying transmission in his car
• Finishing the ramp on the deck he has been working SO HARD on for the past year
(mostly by himself)
• With whatever may be left, enriching our lives with whatever else can help us live comfortably 




It may seem like a lot of money, but these things would mean the world to my Dad, and by extension to me! Even if you can’t give, you can still help, if we all spread the word out to as many people as possible, I have hope and confidence that we can make it happen! Help me give back to the man who has given me everything I’ve ever known. 




Thank you so much in advance for your selfless giving, whether it be material, social, or just for your time reading this, thank you so very much! God bless you all!! 




More on O.I.
[osteogenesis imperfecta  or O.I. basically means brittle bone disease. There are several different types of O.I. ours being close to the most severe. He and I each have broken many bones in our lifetimes, well over 100 times total, mainly in our extremities. We've been in wheelchairs our whole lives, at least since early childhood. We have had numerous bone repairing surgeries and have spent countless hours, and in the case of my Dad, WEEKS in hospitals.

I’ve been in a chair all my life and use both an electric and push chair. These chairs serve their purpose but I also enjoy outdoor activities which include hunting, fishing and four wheeling. My current wheelchairs have limited me to not being able to travel over rough terrain. With family, friends and myself getting older it is getting tougher and tougher to get to some of these remote areas.While I do work and I try to be an independent individual the cost of an off-road chair that I have been considering is quite expensive. Insurance does not cover something like this as they say it’s not a necessity so it would have to come out of my own pocket. Normally I would not ask for help from others as it’s just not something that I would do but this new chair would open new ways to explore my passion for the outdoors.The chair that I have been considering is The Action TrackChair. This chair is one of many off-road wheelchairs that are out on the market currently and can take you places you didn’t think possible. With the Action TrackChair I’d have the freedom to go hunting, fishing, to the beach, camping and much more.  Click the link to check out this beast!

I have osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) a brittle bone disease. I have had 22 surgeries, and am not supposed to walk by the age of 17. I have broken nearly every bone in my body, and cast are one of my best friends.It has been a struggle, yet I wouldn’t of asked for it any easier because I wouldn’t be who I am today. My disability doesn’t define me, it is only part of me. I am a avid part of my school community; I am the president of the peer mentoring. I work very hard academically, I am very thankful I have teachers and staff who work with me, to make me more successful. I want to be able to learn and have the same academic opportunities as others around me. My whole life I have found myself with numerous challenges, I was never able to participate in a lot of activities, I can not play any sports and if I did they would have to be adapted in several ways, I can’t run or jump, my legs hurt almost constantly and if I fall I almost always break a bone. My disability has put up a lot of boundaries for me. I tried riding a bike, fell and broke my femur. The day I was baptised as I was walking out of the church I had fallen and broken my left wrist, forearm and my femur also the day before my birthday. I have struggled with this since the age of 5, when I was diagnosed. I attend adaptive adventures as much as possible, to be able to be as active as possible. My disability has not stopped me, I went snow tubing when I was 7 and broke my femur. I ride a 4 wheel bike when I am with adaptive adventures, as well as wake and paddle board. I did a 5K about two years ago. The world may have barriers for me, I will always find away over them. My next adventure is a trip with school to Rome, Italy. My mother and I are attempting to raise the money to go, my mother going to be able to help me and support me when I need it. I need her there to be able to make me more comfortable, to help support me, if I need to rest she would stay with me for that allotted time and if I were to get hurt to have her there to help with all of the medical that would be followed. My mom is also one of my best friends, because she always helps me when I am hurt. I really want to go see the beauty of Rome before I no longer have my legs. We will be going into the coliseum and on the Spanish Steps, which I would need to be able to walk for. If this was the first and last trip I had before I couldn’t walk anymore then let it be the best trip I have ever been on. We don’t have enough money to be able to swing the trip without help. With medical bills, and the cost of the insurance every month we wouldn’t be able to swing the cost and still pay the bills. I have always dreamed of leaving the United States, I have always dreamed of going to meet new people, see new absolutely amazing things. I want to travel, I want to step into Rome and say “I made it.” I want to learn everything I can about music, writing, genetics, psychology, culture, literature, history, people, and the world. I want to find more of myself in different places. Please support my mom and I on going to Rome for this trip. Please know how much your support and love means to my family and I. Thank you in advance for reading my story, thank you for supporting me, and if you choose to donate thank you. There are no word in the world for me to use to demonstrate how important this is to me and how much I appreciate your donation to help me get to Rome before my legs no longer support me.",,,https://www.gofundme.com/c24ynwng#,,,

My name is Stephen. I was born with a Genetic Mutation that manifested in osteogenesis Imperfect (Commonly known as ""Brittle Bone Disease"". I am currently 30 years old and throughout my life I have dealt with some pretty awful effects of this most tragic disorder. I will go into why I have started this particular campaign here in a few minutes but first I wanted to share a kink to some info on what my condition consists of and what personal hell it has brought me over the course of my life. I thank you for bearing with me as due to my current, rather time-sensitive issue.This link will give you a run down on what OI is to a certain degree. I have had the genetic screening to confirm this is what I have twice. Once as a youth and once as an Adult. https://www.bones.nih.gov/health-info/bone/osteogenesis-imperfecta/osteogenesis-imperfecta-ffMy personal issue with OI has been a long 30 year journey. In that time I have accumulated 407 fractures (excluding fingers, ribs, and toes as I cannot count that high, dozens of surgeries (In fact I am currently recovering from an ankle reconstruction W/ hardware that was done on April, 12, 2018).  As a metabolic & collagen disorder OI also causes loose joints causing dislocations on an almost daily basis as well as other health issues such as respiratory, auditory, etc... (oh and the whites of my eyes are blue). That is a very simple breakdown of what I deal with. There is much more but hopefully the NIH link will help with some more information.My current situation is a little more dire than I care to admit. See OI attacks my teeth viciously as well and I currently have many broken teeth due to OI and that does little for my mental image but the real problem is that I have 2 molars and 2 front teeth that have broken and shattered leaving one with half a tooth, one with just root posts left, and two very sharp front teeth that became jagged when they broke. I am not usually very open when it comes to my teeth as I am mortified by how they look due to this damn mutation.The reason I am starting this particular campaign is because the two molars that have broken are infected on and off and abscess often. Neither my meager dental coverage will fix it or Ortho surgeons refer me back to Dental because it is teeth and it is, allegedly not a medical problem until it gets into my heart or brain.I am simply seeking some assistance so as to get these issues fixed before the current infection becomes systematic. I hate doing this but with the Capitalist vultures in the United States caring not for the patients but the bottom line leaves people like me screwed, to put it bluntly. All proceeds will be used to get my teeth into a semi-respectable working order again so I am not worried about dying from a tooth like a few I know have. I am anxious, scared, lonely, isolated and I really do not want to die. The help would mean the absolute world to me and I swear to somehow pay it back or pay it forward. I intend to supplement what I get here with selling of my stuff to make sure I get the treatment I need and not have to lay awake at night and wonder whether my teeth with be what kills me. This is severely impacting my mental and my physical well-being and of course the Capitalist health system in the US does not care much about that.I just was to be able to smile again, that would be monumental for me.Thank you for reading this and hope you can see it in your heat to help a fellow human who is terrified and at the end of his rope.Sincerely,Stephen H.God bless you all",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/CMDRLiquidKittensTeeth#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/CMDRLiquidKittensTeeth#,,,

Despite all of her diagnoses and predictions given by her, doctors, specialists and therapists, she has gone on to defy the odds and live a productive life with the dedication and assistance of those who love her. She does not allow anyone to tell her what she cannot do and has the personality and loving spirit where she shows her appreciation to any and all that help.Because of her O.I., Adrianne is unable to do many things for herself. She is creative enough to find ways to do many of her daily routines, but needs assistance. As she gets older, physical activities become more of a challenge but she has a caregiver who is her best friend and dedicates himself to making her life as normal as possible. They also have an awesome support system in Sicklerville, New Jersey, where she chose to settle.Adrianne successfully completed a year of college at Savannah College of Art and Design in Atlanta, living on campus in an handicapped accessible room with an extraordinary roommate and friends. She was a Fashion Design major and  very successful,  but it took a toll on her body. She developed some respiratory issues that made continuing this daily routine, difficult.  Although she was a excellent student she reluctantly decided to give up her campus life. Not giving up, Adrianne went on to train with ACTORS, MODELS, AND TALENT FOR CHRIST in Atlanta, where her classes were easier to manage.  She was a natural performer winning the top awards, out of 958 participants of all ages, at the 2014 International SHINE Awards Event in Kissimmee, Florida.  She has been contacted recently to do two auditions and now can  obtain roles or be booked for performances. Her skills have been recognized and acknowledged by some of the top producers and agents in the industry.  Now that she is fully  recovered from breaking both hips at different times over the last two years, she is ready to resume where she left off. Adrianne was able to get through the process of getting an updated Power Wheel Chair on June 13, 2018,  which now allows her life as a productive individual. She is ready to return to mentoring and encouraging other young people with disabilities and do more professional acting and training but needs to obtain a vehicle that this chair can fit into. Getting her chair anywhere right now is a challenge, so we are looking to obtain a vehicle with a larger back opening that her chair can roll into with the aide of a portable ramp, which we have already purchased. The current vehicle that her caregiver has cannot accommodate this wheel chair without  taking the entire back off and on with each use. This is a major problem because removing the back of the chair is not recommended for removal at anytime due to the delicacy of the controls and wiring that operate her chair. (See picture)Adrianne needs these funds to put down on a different vehicle that her chair can get into without taking the back off of the chair and putting the back on with each use. She uses her chair all day in different locations and this is a tedious process. Byron and I  are the only ones who can take the back off of her chair and put it back on. The dealership where they purchased their current 2007 Acura SUV,  said they want to work with them but would need the money for tags, taxes, and down payment which would come to about $2, 400.00 as soon as possible. The dealership said as soon as they could get the money, they could get them into another vehicle with minimal change in monthly payments. Any money raised will ALL go to the dealership to make this happen, ASAP.We do not have this kind of money.I am Adrianne's Mom and live in Georgia.  Retirement was done early to take care of Adrianne to get her to where she is today. Contributing to Adrianne's continued care  is what I still do .  (Adrianne's father is deceased.) Byron, Adrianne's caretaker,  makes Adrianne's life possible because he can lift her and address her needs, which have become more physically challenging for me.Team Poo's Wheels, is comprised of myself, Byron and Adrianne.  We are hard working, dedicated, and determined to get this done so that Adrianne can immediately improve her Quality of Life. She soooooooo deserves this!!!!!!!!! Your greatest gift would be to share with others. Please find it in your hearts to give!  Any amount is appreciatedThanks so much in Advance.                                                                                                       TEAM POO'S WHEELS",,,https://www.gofundme.com/vehicle-for-adrianne039s-new-chair#,,,

I have had over 300 broken bones, but other than that, I consider that I've had a pretty normal happy life. I have 2 lovely grown daughters, a beautiful and active 3 year old grandson, and the most wonderful husband a woman could ask for. He too, is disabled, but together we make a really awesome team. I say team for that's what we really are, for we take care of my 90 year old mother who is bedridden and has Alzheimer's. I couldn't do it without him, so I thank God everyday that he saw fit to send me such a great man!      Due to my disability, I have been in a manual wheelchair most of my life. In 1999, I was in a bad car accident, and due to my neck injuries, I had to get a power chair which is a lot more trouble to transport. Up until this time, I was a very independent woman. I worked for AT&T, traveled with a gospel singing group, and did all the wife and mom things like take kids to practices, ball games , etc. I could just pop my chair in the backseat and take off. My childrens' friends even gave me the name Motormama, for they said I never stayed still and kept the motor running in my car all the time. After the car wreck, life got harder, for I had this power wheelchair that I couldn't get around without. Also, I couldn't just up and go with it, for I didn't have a way to haul it and was unable to go without it.       Luckily, I was fortunate to find a used van with a lift that I could afford, drive, and get in and out of by myself with my power chair. But, as with most used vehicles, they only last so long. Soon again, I was stranded!      My husband and I were fortunate enough to find another used van that was in good shape but didn't have a lift. We resorted to using ramps. The ramps were not very safe, and actually dangerous, for I fell off of them more times than I want to remember. We finally found a used lift that would fit in the van. There is one drawback though. I can't get in and out of the van by myself because of the solid floor in the lift. There is no way for me to open or shut the doors of the van from the inside. This means I have lost my independence. Instead of being able to take my grandson somewhere by myself or run an errand when my husband doesn't feel like it, I have to wait for someone to come and take me anywhere that I need to go or make my husband go do it. My husband has had some health issues recently that has taken a toll on both of us, and I feel so inadequate as a wife that I can't do anything to take some of the pressure off him simply because I have no way to go that I can maneuver by myself.      Now that my mother is bedridden and can't talk anymore, she can't be left at home for one minute alone. With the situation as it is with the driving problems, my husband is always the one that has to go, and I am the one who has to stay home, for we can seldom leave together unless we have a sitter for mom. Sitters are very expensive and not really affordable when you live on disability. We have checked on a van that I could use by myself and the salesman even said he'd get me in one, but then when he gave us the payment price, it was more than our disability checks! So, buying one and making payments is not an option.      I am so thankful just to have a way of going. Unfortunately, as I said before, the van and lift I have is used (1998) and has recently started having mechanical problems. I fear that once again I will be stranded.  I've already had it in the shop 3 times in the past 4 months for repairs. Each time, I was stuck at home for over a week.     I would so LOVE to have a van that I could use on my own, so I could be more independent and also take a little of the load off my husband's shoulders. Under the circumstances, I know that's not possible on our income. That's why I have set up this account. I would be so appreciative to any and everybody that could help me make my dream come true. My dream is to have a wheelchair accessible handicapped van that could give me back my independence and let me be more helpful to my family!",Updates   9,https://www.gofundme.com/w63kyha2#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/w63kyha2#,,,

Mason has seizures every day, they are intense and always begin with a “jackknife” he folds forward with his arms and legs straighten up.  He also has brittle bone disease so we have to make sure there is nothing around to restrict his movements during a seizure due to his high risk of breaking bones (this has happened three times).  The Toyota offers the most interior room of any conversion on the market.   It affords us the ability to place his chair where he would not hit his legs on the seat in front of him during a seizure.   It is also the only option for a “jump seat” (a fold-down seat next to him for his nurse/caregiver to assist during trips to and from appointments).  The cost:So how much might a Toyota Mini-Van with a ramp cost one might ask???  The two quotes we received were between $71,000 and $75,000… you know just the cost of your basic Porsche but you still get all the glory of driving a swagger wagon!How you can help:Now we are left with figuring out how to pay for this vantastic beastmobile.  We love all of our kids so selling one isn’t an option.  Grant applications thus far have been denied, a loan payment would take the place of our mortgage and although roomy, there’s not enough room for our family of six to actually live in it.  So here we are reaching out to our family, friends and community, humbly requesting your help.

Tyler suffers from onset osteogenesis imperfecta Type 1, onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, Reactive Airway Disease or underdeveloped lungs and Genetic Fibromyalgia. Tyler also suffers from a seizure disorder due to an onset of fainting/falling, dizziness, confusion, paleness, spacing out, discoloration of lips and hot and extreme cold flashes. Tyler’s heart is also weakening, possibly on the path of beginning to fail. You can only imagine all of the doctor and hospital visits, tests and medications that go along with all of these complications.


These are the things Tyler suffers from, but they do not define him. We’ve come to learn quite quickly that this young man has not let his medial issues take complete control of his life. He is a vibrant person and has an amazing talent with words, writing short stories and poetry as an outlet.Help us bring Tyler a little ray of sunshine and ease of getting around by joining us at the Wheels For Tyler event, where we will present Tyler and his family with a motorized mobility chair and chair lift, to aid him getting around much easier.


We learned about Tyler Calci from a friend of the club, the beautiful, caring and selfless, Sheila Jean Moss. This past Leesburg Bikefest, Tyler was supposed to accompany Sheila to the bikefest to go have some fun and meet a bunch of us and we were all very excited and eager to meet him. Well, Tyler couldn't even really get out of bed that morning, so it didn't happen. Shaun Sheridan (Mongo) mentioned we should ride out to see him one day soon, to maybe put a smile on his face. Well, that post by Shaun on Facebook took on a life of its own and here we are with a charity event in Tyler's name. We will have a ride, mapped and captained by Wally Oelkers. We will have a stop at Bud Mc Kethan Park in Brooksville, to meet Tyler and his family and then we'll be heading to High Octane Saloon in Homosassa to finish out the day.


At Bud Mc Kethan Park in Brooksville, Vanir - Riding Club and friends will be donating an almost brand new motorized mobility scooter to Tyler, to make his getting around on a daily basis an easier task. We have the chair, batteries and charger and it's a beautiful piece of equipment found by Vanir member, Phyllis Sheridan (Bubbles). Vanir member, Jen Brat Margeson has donated a motorized chair lift for the back of a vehicle to get the chair around. It needs motor work, which Vanir member, Steve Comer, is going to have a look at. Steve and Linda Matte of Mattes Embroidery and Custom Designs are donating a set of Vanir patches, so we can make Tyler an honorary member of the club. Ironside is donating some jewelry and Vanir t-shirts for both mom and Tyler. Eaglerider Motorcycles Orlando will be making a donation for the event as well!We want to make this event HUGE! Help spread the word! It's Vanir sponsored, but everyone and anyone is invited to ride and meet Tyler and his family. Please read the attached flyer to learn more about Tyler and see the details of the event.Special thanks to Shaun Sheridan, Phyllis Sheridan, Jen Brat Margeson, Gummi Sig, Steve Comer, Steve Matte, Linda Matte, Sheila Jean Moss, Joshua Porter, Lora Bonifacio and Chris Thumann.Advanced Golf & Electric Vehicles Mattes Embroidery and Custom Designs Ironside Eaglerider Motorcycles OrlandoA&J Cycles 100% of proceeds to benefit Tyler and his family.

When Carter was born we immediately knew that something was wrong physically, and soon after we were seeing specialist after specialist. The first years were rough; no clear diagnosis, misdiagnosis and lots of physical therapy. At a year old he was finally able to roll over and in a year and half could sit independently for short amounts of time, but with physical therapy 3 days a week at Shriners Children’s Hospital he was making great improvements not only physically but with his speech as well!We had finally got into a rhythm with our new life when one day in 2015, Carter was riding in the car when we were suddenly cut off in traffic, causing us to brake to a jarring stop in avoiding a collision. Nothing was alarming at first and Carter seemed fine, but weeks later a golf ball sized bump on his collar bone started to form… off to the Doctor we went. At first they told us it was an infection, then a tumor, and finally after a CT scan it showed it was a broken collar bone… but not only a broken collar bone, we also found several healed broken ribs ranging from months to years old. We couldn’t believe it! How could we have not known our baby had broken bones? He never cried, complained, or even bruised. What could have been going on? More tests, bloodwork and scans, and within a few days a Geneticist walked into our room at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital and gave us the news; Bruck Syndrome. Bruck Syndrome is an extremely rare genetic deformation made up of two diseases; osteogenesis imperfecta and Arthrogryposis. Our baby Carter was the 27th documented case in the world.Because of his disability Carter has extremely brittle or soft bones, little bone density and is currently unable to stand independently. The only way for him to build bone density is to stand, and he can’t stand while bearing his own weight without special equipment. This is why we made the decision to start this page:All of Carters Doctors agree that with a piece of equipment called a Stander he would be able to build the bone density he needs to almost certainly walk, but without it he stands no chance. Carter is not cognitively disabled, and although his verbal communication is behind he is above his age mentally and is as smart as a whip; he knows he should be able to walk, run and play like his friends, but without the equipment he needs he never will be able to.  A wonderful woman anonymously purchased a walker, called a Gait Trainer for Carter and it has been such a blessing to him. Seeing his smile when he can “walk” on his own is something that brings tears to our eyes, but unfortunately he needs so much more. The Gait Trainer teaches him how to step and starts the process of him spending his time upright, but will never be able to give him the tools he needs to actually walk independently. We have fought with Carters insurance company for over a year to get him the equipment he needs and deserves, starting even before the diagnosis of Bruck Syndrome, but so far Insurance hasn’t approved anything, instead have declined 7 different times to where we are to the point of having to start the appeal process that could drag on for months.If you find yourself in a position to donate to our family, we would be forever grateful. Any money we raise will be put toward buying Carter the equipment he DESERVES that we cant afford on our own. His Stander alone, requiring custom fitting is $16,000; but we'd also hope to purchase an electric wheelchair so that he can keep up with his friends while learning to walk, which is another $18,000.  Any money not immediately put towards these peices of equiptment will be used to give our son the best quality of life possible. Every child deserves the chance to walk and the opportunity for a full life, especially my baby. Thank you so much for reading Carters Story (so far!), and even if you cannot donate please share our story & take a look at Carters photos and videos we’ve attached, I know he will bring a smile to your face! It happens to everyone who meets him…Thank you!Carters Mom, Kailey Smith",Updates   1,https://www.gofundme.com/carterryansmith#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/carterryansmith#,,,

El tratamiento de esta enfermedad se basa en la colocación intravenosa de un medicamento llamado ACLASTA que se le coloca al paciente cada seis meses para poder disminuir los dolores y evitar frecuentes fracturas. Este procedimiento se realiza de por vida ya que esta patología no tiene cura. La única manera de tratar las frecuentes fracturas es introducir en el hueso afectado de manera quirúrgica clavos y prótesis endomedulares y telescópicas.Anthuan ha sufrido más de 70 fracturas y 5 intervenciones quirúrgicas en sus 12 años de vida, además posee clavos intramedulares en cada fémur y una prótesis de cadera. Hace unos días sufrió un accidente y se fracturó el fémur izquierdo, tuvo desplazamiento del miembro y la prótesis sufrió un ondulamiento severo, motivo por el cual tiene que ser remplazado. Lamentablemente en Venezuela no hay material ni personal capacitado para realizar la intervención, y la única opción viable es viajar a Colombia lo más pronto posible, donde se encuentra residenciado y laborando desde hace dos años el Dr. Miguel Gabán, médico y cirujano tratante de Anthuan desde que nació.En este momento los padres de Anthuan no poseen los recursos necesarios para la operación ni para el viaje a Colombia, es por esto que estamos solicitando esta ayuda. Cualquier donativo puede hacer la diferencia para mejorar la salud de Anthuan y poder dale una calidad de vida mejor. Anthuan y sus padres estarán muy agradecidos por su ayuda.___________________________________________________________ Anthuan Villalobos, a 12-year-old Venezuelan, suffers from a disease called osteogenesis imperfecta, which is characterized by bowing, deformations, frequent fractures throughout the skeletal system and chronic pain. The treatment of this disease is based on the intravenous insertion of a medicine called ACLASTA that is placed to the patient every six months in order to reduce the pain and avoid frequent fractures. This procedure is performed for life as this pathology has no cure. The only way to treat the frequent fractures is to insert surgically-impaired nails and prostheses into endomedullary and telescopic prostheses.Anthuan has suffered more than 70 fractures and has undergone 5 surgeries during his 12 years of life. He also has intramedullary nails in each femur and a hip prosthesis. A few days ago he suffered an accident and fractured the left femur, had displacement of the limb and the prosthesis suffered a severe undulation, which is why it has to be replaced. Unfortunately in Venezuela there is no material or trained personnel to perform the intervention, and the only viable option is to travel to Colombia as soon as possible, where his long time doctor and surgeon, Dr. Miguel Gabán, is now living and working. At this time Anthuan's parents don’t have the resources for the operation or for the trip to Colombia, which is why we are requesting this help. Any donation can make a difference to improve Anthuan's health and give him a better quality of life. Anthuan and his parents will be very grateful for your help.",Updates   2,https://www.gofundme.com/anthuanvillalobos#updates,https://www.gofundme.com/anthuanvillalobos#,,,
